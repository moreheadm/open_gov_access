# PS3 - Mission Local: Supercharging Civic Data Investigations

## **Overview**

In a city as data-rich yet opaque as San Francisco, the truth often hides in plain sight. Mission Local’s journalists work tirelessly to hold the local government accountable—but the city’s fragmented, inconsistently formatted civic data makes that mission harder than ever. Campaign filings live apart from business permits, budget ledgers don’t align with complaint records, and critical updates often appear without notice. The result: reporters spend weeks cleaning data instead of breaking stories. **Mission Local** challenges participants to **supercharge civic accountability** by building tools that **transform chaotic public datasets into real-time, intelligible insights**—empowering journalists to uncover patterns of corruption, inequity, and impact faster than ever before, and helping democracy keep pace with the data age.

### **Who We Are**

**Mission Local** is an award-winning, independent newsroom dedicated to covering San Francisco’s most critical stories—especially those missed by major outlets. Our investigative journalists are at the front lines of holding local government accountable and surfacing issues of public concern. However, the increasingly complex, fragmented landscape of San Francisco’s open civic data has created new roadblocks for transparency and rapid reporting.

### **The Challenge**

San Francisco publishes vast quantities of government data, from campaign finance filings and building complaints to business permits, budgets, and sales tax records. But this data is:

- **Scattered:** Siloed across departments and platform
- **Poorly documented:** Lacking field explanations or contextual guides
- **Hard to work with:** Locked in non-machine-readable PDFs, updated without notification, or missing standard formats

Journalists spend weeks manually wrangling this data—limiting their ability to break urgent stories, connect systemic patterns, or follow up on public accountability leads in real time.

**What’s at stake?**

If journalists can’t quickly make sense of public records, stories of government malfeasance, public safety, and social impact will go unreported. Public trust in civic institutions and democracy depends on access to intelligible, actionable information.

### **What to Build**

We need new tools—not another static dashboard—to make government data **intelligible, actionable, and real-time** for journalists and the public:

**Build solutions that could include:**

- **Synthesize and contextualize** location-based data (e.g., for a given address or neighborhood) across multiple government sources
- **Automatically flag patterns, anomalies, or correlations** (e.g., clusters of building complaints, links between business closures and tax changes)
- **Provide real-time alerts** when new filings or relevant records are posted
- **Explain and verify**: Offer automated field explanations, source documentation, and journalistic verification support

**Sample approaches:**

1. **AI-powered data integration:** Seamlessly merge and annotate disparate datasets for a single location, entity, or trend
2. **Automated anomaly detection:** Alert journalists to newsworthy spikes or outliers as soon as they appear
3. **Intelligent documentation systems:** Generate field definitions and context for poorly labeled data, reducing dependence on expert knowledge

*The goal is not to produce a one-off analysis or dashboard, but to deliver new, reusable technical methods that radically improve how accountability insights are extracted from public data.*

### **Sample Use Cases**

- Instantly aggregating all permits, complaints, and tax filings for a given building or business
- Surfacing patterns of government spending and budget allocations by neighborhood
- Notifying reporters of new campaign contributions or suspicious activity in city contracts

### **Dataset & Resources**

Below are some pointers and suggested datasets to work on:

### **Judging Criteria**

- **Technical Execution:** Is the solution robust, demoable, and capable of handling real-world data complexity?
- **User Experience:** Does it save journalists significant time and mental effort? Is it easy to learn and use?
- **Innovation:** Are you leveraging new methods (AI, NLP, automation) to solve the *core* pain points, not just replicating basic reporting features?
- **Storytelling/Insight Impact:** Does your tool help surface urgent, actionable civic stories?
- **Verification & Attribution:** Does the solution make it clear where data comes from, and enable journalistic standards of source verification?

**Bonus:** Solutions with clear next steps for integration at Mission Local, or that can be easily piloted by other local newsrooms.
