# Resources from Mission Local

**Resources for Hack for Social Impact x Mission Local**

- Machine-readable versions (CSV/JSON) of key civic datasets your team uses (e.g., permits, complaints, budgets, tax records, business registrations, etc.)
    - Campaign finance disclosures, these are filed as PDFs but for each election there is a [dashboard](https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-dashboards) where you can download a summary CSV.
        - State filings are available at [CalAccess](https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/default.aspx).
    - [Supplier contract data](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Supplier-Contracts/cqi5-hm2d/about_data)
    - [Building permits](https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Building-Permits/i98e-djp9/about_data)
    - [SFPD crime dashboard](https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/stay-safe/crime-data/crime-dashboard) (download available)
        - Similar data going back further + for all counties in California is published by the [California Department of Justice](https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/exploration/crime-statistics/crimes-clearances)
    - [Property assessment data](https://www.sf.gov/resource--2024--secured-property-tax-data)

    - [Election results](https://www.sf.gov/election-results)

    - [Census data](https://data.census.gov/)
    - [Police Department incident reports](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data)

    - [San Francisco’s streets](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Streets-Active-and-Retired/3psu-pn9h/about_data)

*Things that aren’t in CSV format but could be converted*

- Board of Supervisors [meeting agendas](https://sfbos.org/meetings/full-board-meetings).
    - Agendas are published as PDFs but having a dataset created from these would be really helpful.
- San Francisco’s [budget](https://www.sf.gov/budget-process-documents-for-fiscal-years-2026-2027)
    - The budget is included under the “annual appropriation ordinance linked on the page above. Similarly, Joe Eskenazi wrote a column in 2023 about San Francisco’s, which was based around a records request for how much the city [spends on toilet paper](https://missionlocal.org/2023/09/san-francisco-spends-how-much-on-toilet-paper/).
- Field/column explanations or data dictionaries, if available
    - Some of the links above include dictionaries, I do not have any additional ones.
- Examples of records or cases that have led to important stories or accountability outcomes
    - [Explore San Francisco’s budget](https://missionlocal.org/2025/05/explore-san-francisco-2024-2025-budget/)
        - Story to help understand San Francisco’s massive, complicated budget
    - [Explore: $70M in SF law enforcement settlements](https://missionlocal.org/2023/06/millions-law-enforcement-sfpd-sheriff-lawsuit-settlements/)
        - I believe the data for this came via records request
    - [Trump says SF ‘went wrong.’ Crime data shows otherwise.](https://missionlocal.org/2025/10/trump-sf-went-wrong-crime-data-down/)
        - Quick accountability story using crime data
    - [San Francisco’s forgotten roads: Bayview has 1/4 of city’s ‘unaccepted streets](https://missionlocal.org/2025/07/sf-bayview-unaccepted-streets/)’
        - Story using the streets data linked about
    - [Over 1/4 of S.F.’s drug arrests or citations now come from 16th and Mission](https://missionlocal.org/2025/04/sf-drug-arrests-citations-16th-street-mission-data/)
        - Story based on the police incident reports linked above
- Any API documentation, access keys, or data-sharing agreements needed for developers
    - I believe some of the links (from OpenData) above can be accessed via API.
- List of most commonly referenced records by your journalists (helpful for sample data)
    - We look at a lot of these datasets on a regular basis! I’d say especially the campaign finance filings, budget documents, meeting agendas and crime data.
- Historical datasets or reports that teams can use for testing and prototyping
    - Many of the datasets linked above include historical data.
