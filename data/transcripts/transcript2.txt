00:23:38 THEY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND STAFF RESOURCES THEIR
00:23:41 DEPARTMENTS HAVE DEVOTED TO COMPLYING WITH OUR SURVEILLANCE
00:23:45 TECHNOLOGY ORDINANCE. I WILL ASK THAT THIS BE
00:23:48 ESTIMATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SINCE ITS ENACTMENT IN 2019
00:23:51 MANY SAN FRANCISCANS WILL RECALL THAT THIS ORDINANCE
00:23:55 ADMINISTRATIVE CODE CHAPTER 19 BE ACQUISITION OF SURVEILLANCE
00:23:58 TECHNOLOGY PLACED RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF FACIAL
00:24:00 RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. FAR LESS WELL KNOWN, HOWEVER,
00:24:03 WAS THAT IT ALSO IMPOSED SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH REPORTING
00:24:07 OVERSIGHT AND ITERATIVE ENGAGEMENT BURDENS ON CITY

00:24:49 COURT SUBCOMMITTEE WHERE SUBMISSIONS ARE SCRUTINIZED BY
00:24:51 AT LEAST ONE MEETING OF THE PRIVACY SURVEILLANCE ADVISORY

00:25:12 PLAINTIFFS FEES AND COSTS PROVISION WHICH I CONSIDER TO
00:25:15 BE A DISSERVICE TO OUR TAXPAYERS AND FRANKLY A
00:25:19 BRAZENLY SELF-DEALING SOP TO ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS WHO SUE
00:25:23 MUNICIPALITIES. HOWEVER, IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY
00:25:24 ATTENTION THAT ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS MAY ONLY BE A DROP
00:25:27 IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO THE VASTLY LARGER INVESTMENT OF
00:25:31 TIME IN TAXPAYER FUNDED RESOURCES FOR CITY AGENCIES TO
00:25:34 COMPLY WITH THIS ORDINANCE. THIS LETTER THESE LETTERS OF

00:25:50 AND COURT FOR THEIR ESTIMATIONS OF STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES.
00:25:53 THAT ADMIN CODE 19 BE COMPLIANCE AS IMPOSED ON THEIR
00:25:57 OFFICERS AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY CONSCIENTIOUS ACTIVISTS
00:26:01 AND LEADERS ARE DOING MUCH NEEDED WORK TO IMPROVE
00:26:05 EFFICIENCIES AND CUT NEEDLESS WASTE IN SAN FRANCISCO'S LOCAL
00:26:08 GOVERNMENT ON COMMISSION STREAMLINING ON CONTRACTING
00:26:11 REFORM ON CHARTER REFORM AND MORE.
00:26:15 I THINK WE ARE ALL BEST SERVED BY AN ESTIMATION OF COSTS
00:26:18 IMPOSED BY A LAW THAT ALSO HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR
00:26:20 PUBLIC SAFETY AND EFFECTIVE POLICING IN SAN FRANCISCO.
00:26:23 I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CLERK AND DEPARTMENT HEADS
00:26:27 AS WE GATHER DATA TO BETTER INFORM POLICY DECISIONS WHICH
00:26:30 WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE LOCAL GOVERNMENT MORE COST EFFECTIVE
00:26:34 AND OUR CITY SAFER AND THE REST I SUBMIT.

00:27:00 TODAY I AM VERY, VERY HONORED TO COMMEND CHO CHANG YAO ON
00:27:05 THE OCCASION OF HER 107TH BIRTHDAY LATER THIS YEAR.
00:27:09 A REMARKABLE MILESTONE THAT REFLECTS A LEGACY THAT REFLECTS
00:27:16 A LIFE OF STRENGTH, OF PERSEVERANCE AND OF FAMILY.
00:27:20 NOW I'M NOT SURE I CAN SAY THAT YOU ARE NECESSARILY THE OLDEST
00:27:25 LIVING SAN FRANCISCAN TODAY BUT YOU'RE THE OLDEST LIVING THAT I

00:27:51 IN HONOLULU, HAWAII ON JUNE 9TH, 1918, THE FOURTH OF NINE
00:27:55 SIBLINGS. NOW I FOUND THIS INTERESTING
00:27:58 YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE ONLY HAS FOUR DIGITS.
00:28:02 AND NOW HAWAII USES TEN. WHEN YOU WERE JUST TWO YEARS
00:28:03 OLD, HER FAMILY RETURNED TO CHINA AS HER FATHER JOINED DR.
00:28:07 SUN YAT SEN'S REVOLUTION A POWERFUL CONNECTION TO HISTORY

00:28:36 GRANDCHILDREN. WITH THE FAMILY CONTINUING TO
00:28:40 GROW. TODAY MRS. CHOOSE, ONE OF THE
00:28:44 OLDEST LIVING RESIDENTS IN SAN FRANCISCO IN HER LIFE IS THAT
00:28:47 TESTAMENT TO LOVE, TO RESILIENCE AND THE ENDURING
00:28:48 SPIRIT OF FAMILY. HER LEGACY LIVES ON NOT ONLY
00:28:51 THROUGH HER MANY DESCENDANTS BUT ALSO THROUGH HER
00:28:55 GRANDDAUGHTER LESLIE HIEU, WHO FOUNDED PIERCE'S PLEDGE
00:28:58 IN HONOR OF HER LATE SON PIERCE.
00:28:59 LESLIE UNFORTUNATELY COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY BUT IS
00:29:02 REPRESENTED BY HER PARENTS TERESA AND HOWARD.
00:29:06 HUGH, WHO FOUND LESLIE HAS TRANSFORMED UNIMAGINABLE LOSS
00:29:10 INTO ADVOCACY WORKING TO PREVENT FAMILY VIOLENCE
00:29:11 AND PROMOTE FIREARMS SAFETY REFORMS SO THAT OTHER FAMILIES
00:29:15 MAY NEVER FACE THE SAME TRAGEDY NOW THAT COURAGE, THAT
00:29:19 COMPASSION THAT DEFINED LESLIE'S WORK ARE A REFLECTION
00:29:22 OF THE SAME STRENGTH THAT HAS CARRIED MRS. CHIU THROUGH MORE
00:29:27 THAN A CENTURY OF LIFE THAT LIFE OF PURPOSE, THAT LIFE OF
00:29:30 LOVE, THAT LIFE OF FAMILY ACROSS GENERATIONS.
00:29:34 SO TODAY WE CELEBRATE YOU CHOOSING YOUR ONE FOR YOUR
00:29:39 LONGEVITY BUT REALLY FOR YOUR FAMILY'S LEGACY OF SERVICE
00:29:43 AND FOR THE LIGHT THAT SO MANY MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY HAVE
00:29:46 TOLD ME THAT YOU BRING TO THEM AND TO EVERYONE IN OUR CITY.

00:44:58 THAT YOU'VE BEEN A VETERAN, THAT PERSON BEEN A VETERAN
00:45:02 AND GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THAT THEY LOVE THIS
00:45:06 COUNTRY AND LOVED THEMSELVES. >> THANK YOU
00:45:41 SO. >> DISTRICT SIX SUPERVISOR
00:45:57 DORSEY THANK YOU PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN.
00:46:01 COLLEAGUES, IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO OFFER THIS COMMENDATION FOR
00:46:04 MARIA TAN WHOSE DAUGHTER CAROL TAN WILL BE ACCEPTING ON HER
00:46:08 BEHALF. >> THAT'S GIRL STUFF.
00:46:12 WHAT AN HONOR TO CELEBRATE THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF MARIA TAN
00:46:19 . BORN ON SEPTEMBER 25TH, 1921
00:46:22 IN THE PHILIPPINES TO CHINESE IMMIGRANT PARENTS MARIA CARRIED
00:46:23 WITH HER THE COURAGE AND RESILIENCE OF HER FAMILY'S
00:46:27 JOURNEY. IN 1978 SHE CAME TO THE UNITED
00:46:31 STATES AND LATER PROUDLY BECAME AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
00:46:34 SINCE 1982, SAN FRANCISCO HAS BEEN FORTUNATE TO COUNT HER
00:46:38 AMONG ITS OWN RESIDENTS. MARIA STORY WELL REPRESENTS THE
00:46:42 IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE THAT HAS SO POWERFULLY SHAPED OUR CITY
00:46:46 AND CONTINUES TO SHAPE OUR CITY AS WELL.
00:46:49 IT REFLECTS THE STRENGTH, FAITH AND FAITH AND DETERMINATION
00:46:52 THAT DEFINED THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WE SAN FRANCISCANS
00:46:53 CHERISH. FOR MORE THAN THREE DECADES,
00:46:56 MARIA DEVOTED HERSELF TO SERVICE THROUGH HER WORK WITH
00:47:00 SELF-HELP FOR THE ELDERLY AND LATER HER MANY VOLUNTEER
00:47:03 HOURS AT THE OLD SAINT MARY'S BOOKSTORE.
00:47:04 SHE HAS TOUCHED COUNTLESS LIVES WITH QUIET AND STEADY KINDNESS.
00:47:08 HER EXAMPLE REMINDS US THAT TRUE COMMUNITY IS BUILT THROUGH
00:47:12 CONSISTENT ACTS OF GENEROSITY AND CARE.
00:47:15 MARIA'S DEDICATION HAS UPLIFTED AND INSPIRED MANY PEOPLE
00:47:19 AND HER OWN LIFE SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE ONE PERSON CAN MAKE
00:47:23 WHEN THEY FOCUS ON HELPING OTHERS.
00:47:26 MARIA'S LIFE HAS ALSO BEEN RICH IN FAMILY JOY AND CREATIVITY
00:47:30 AND HER CATHOLIC FAITH. A DEVOTED PARISHIONER AT OLD
00:47:31 SAINT MARY'S CATHEDRAL, SHE HAS DRAWN STRENGTH AND FORGED
00:47:35 ENDURING FRIENDSHIPS AMONG HER FAITH COMMUNITY.
00:47:37 SHE HAS FOUND PEACE AMONG THE REDWOODS OF MUIR WOODS AND HAS
00:47:41 SHARED HER LOVE OF POETRY BY READING AND WRITING, OFFERING
00:47:43 BEAUTY AND INSIGHT TO THOSE AROUND HER.
00:47:45 THESE PASSIONS HAVE ENRICHED NOT ONLY HER OWN LIFE BUT HAVE
00:47:49 ALSO BEEN GIFTS TO HER FAMILY, HER FRIENDS AND HER NEIGHBORS.
00:47:53 ABOVE ALL, MARIA'S LEGACY SHINES THROUGH HER FAMILY.
00:47:57 AS A DEVOTED MOTHER OF FOUR. SHE HAS PASSED DOWN THE VALUES
00:48:01 OF LOVE, PERSEVERANCE AND FAITH THAT WILL ENDURE FOR MANY
00:48:04 GENERATIONS TO COME. TODAY AS WE HONOR HER, WE
00:48:05 CELEBRATE HER LIFE'S MILESTONES AND THE LASTING CONTRIBUTIONS
00:48:09 SHE HAS MADE TO THE STRENGTH AND CAREER CHARACTER OF SAN
00:48:13 FRANCISCO. AT THE AGE OF 104 NOTABLY
00:48:16 NEITHER THE OLDEST LIVING SAN FRANCISCO NOR EVEN THE OLDEST
00:48:20 HONOREE TODAY MARIA TAN REMINDS US WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE WITH
00:48:24 PURPOSE. WHILE SHE IS UNABLE TO ACCEPT
00:48:25 THIS COMMENDATION IN PERSON, WE HOPE THAT SHE IS WATCHING ON TV
00:48:31 AND WE WELCOME HER DAUGHTER CAROL, TEN, WHO IS HERE TO ON
00:48:33 HER BEHALF TO ACCEPT THIS HONOR AND TO SAY A FEW WORDS.
00:48:37 >> WELCOME CAROL. TEN.
00:48:43 >> I AM SO HONORED TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF MY MOM WHO IS 104
00:48:52 AND SHE IS VERY FEISTY STILL. SHE STILL SCOLDS ME AND SHE IS
00:48:56 STILL A VERY HAPPY, VIBRANT PERSON AND SHE'S NOW IN A
00:49:00 NURSING HOME AND SHE ASKS EVERY CAREGIVER TO DANCE FOR HER
00:49:04 BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN COMMUNICATE.
00:49:08 >> SHE CAN'T HEAR VERY WELL SO SHE'LL TELL THEM DANCE, YOU
00:49:12 KNOW, AND SHE'LL SHE'LL FORCE PEOPLE TO DANCE.
00:49:13 >> BUT I'M REALLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A MOTHER LIKE HER.
00:49:19 WE WERE HERE WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD IN 1973 ON OUR WAY
00:49:23 BACK TO THE PHILIPPINES BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THE ONLY WAY I
00:49:27 COULD GROW TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON IS TO BE BROUGHT BACK TO
00:49:30 ASIA. >> BUT SHE WAS WRONG.
00:49:31 AND THEN I RETURNED HERE AFTER COLLEGE AND FELL IN LOVE WITH
00:49:34 SAN FRANCISCO IN 1982. BUT SHE TAGGED ALONG AND SHE
00:49:38 CAME TO VISIT ME AND SHE NEVER LEFT AND SHE FOUND THE JOB AS
00:49:46 SUCH VOLUNTEER AT SELF-HELP FOR THE ELDERLY WHO GRACIOUSLY TOOK
00:49:50 HER IN FOR OVER 30 YEARS UNDER THE WINGS OF ANNIE CHUNG
00:49:55 AND SHE HAS BEEN A DEDICATED, YOU KNOW, SERVER BECAUSE SHE
00:50:00 THOUGHT AS A SENIOR CITIZEN IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO GIVE BACK
00:50:04 ESPECIALLY TO THE UNITED STATES AND TO THE CITY OF SAN
00:50:08 FRANCISCO. I TOOK CARE OF MY MOM FOR THE
00:50:12 LAST THREE YEARS AND LEARNED MORE ABOUT HER AND SHE GAVE ME
00:50:14 THE COURAGE TO CONTINUE THIS CIVIC CITIZEN SHIP, YOU KNOW,
00:50:22 DUTY I'M ACTUALLY WORKING CURRENTLY FOR THE SCHOOL
00:50:24 DISTRICT FOUR TO SERVE OUR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS THOUGH I
00:50:30 DON'T GET PAID AS WELL. >> YOU KNOW IF I HAD CHOSEN A
00:50:33 PRIVATE COMPANY TO WORK FOR BUT IT'S A CIVIC DUTY TO WORK FOR
00:50:38 THE CITY AND I'M PROUD TO BE PART OF IT PART OF THIS, YOU
00:50:42 KNOW, CITY AND ACTUALLY THE ONE WHO BROUGHT ME HERE WAS ONE OF
00:50:48 OUR DIRECTORS FROM ONE OF OUR SCHOOLS AND SOMEONE WHO I
00:50:52 CLOSELY WORKED WITH ALSO FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND IT'S
00:50:57 JUST SUCH AN HONOR TO LIVE IN THIS CITY AND HOPEFULLY I
00:51:01 WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE HERE UNTIL I RETIRE
00:51:04 AND DIE HERE. >> BUT ANYWAY SO AGAIN THANK
00:51:08 YOU. IT'S AN HONOR TO RECEIVE THIS
00:51:11 ON BEHALF OF MY MOTHER IS BEAUTIFUL.
00:51:21 THANK YOU SO GRADUATIONS TO ONE AND FINALLY DISTRICT TEN
00:52:10 SUPERVISOR WALTON THANK YOU PRESIDENT MOUNTAIN MAN IF I
00:52:13 COULD HAVE BILLY CORTESE COME UP TO THE PODIUM.
00:52:21 >> COLLEAGUES TODAY WE ARE HONORING BILLY TETCHY AND THE
00:52:25 BELOVED NEIGHBORHOOD INSTITUTION IL PIRATA.
00:52:29 >> FOR GENERATIONS IL PIRATA HAS STOOD AS A GATHERING PLACE
00:52:32 FOR NEIGHBORS, ARTISTS AND FAMILIES A SPACE THAT
00:52:37 EMBODIES THE WARMTH, DIVERSITY AND CREATIVE SPIRIT THAT MAKES
00:52:41 SAN FRANCISCO TRULY SPECIAL. WILL BEGIN AS A FAMILY ENDEAVOR
00:52:45 HAS GROWN INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD LANDMARK PASSED DOWN AND CARED
00:52:49 FOR THROUGH GENERATIONS OF OWNERSHIP DEVOTED TO COMMUNITY
00:52:53 HOSPITALITY AND HEART. THIS IS NOT JUST A BUSINESS.
00:53:00 IT IS A LIVING LEGACY A PLACE WHERE PARENTS WANT BROUGHT
00:53:04 THEIR CHILDREN TO SHARE A MEAL OR A SONG.
00:53:07 AND WHERE THOSE SAME CHILDREN NOW RETURN AS ADULTS TO CREATE
00:53:11 MEMORIES OF THEIR OWN. THROUGH THE YEARS THE FAMILY
00:53:14 BEHIND IL PERATA HAS CONTINUED TO HONOR ITS ROOTS WHILE
00:53:16 WELCOMING NEW FACES. AND I KNOW BILLY'S SISTER
00:53:19 AND MOTHER ARE ALSO HERE AND SHARING THAT EVERYONE WHO
00:53:23 WALKS THROUGH THOSE DOORS FEELS AT HOME.
00:53:27 >> WHEN BILLY'S FAMILY TOOK OVER IL PIRATA BACK IN 1994,
00:53:30 PETROL HILL WAS A DIFFERENT PLACE BUT THROUGH EVERY WAVE OF
00:53:34 CHANGE THROUGH THE TECH BOOMS, THE BUILDING CRANES AND THE
00:53:38 RISING RENTS THEY KEPT IL PERATA GROUNDED.
00:53:42 THEY MADE SURE THERE WAS ALWAYS A PLACE FOR WORKING PEOPLE FOR
00:53:46 MUSICIANS, FOR DREAMERS, FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDED A GOOD MEAL,
00:53:53 GOOD MUSIC AND A FAMILIAR FACE BEHIND THE BAR.
00:53:57 FROM THE ENERGY OF ITS LEGENDARY SALSA NIGHTS TO ITS
00:54:00 ROLE AS A GATHERING PLACE FOR LOCALS AND VISITORS ALIKE, IL
00:54:04 PIRATA HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE THAN A BAR.
00:54:06 IT HAS BEEN A CORNERSTONE OF PETRO HILL WHERE COMMUNITY
00:54:09 CULTURE AND CONNECTION THRIVE AND A CITY THAT CONTINUES TO
00:54:16 EVOLVE. IL PARADA REMINDS US OF WHAT
00:54:17 REMAINS CONSTANT THE POWER OF FAMILY, THE IMPORTANCE OF
00:54:24 NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE ENDURING VALUE OF PLACES THAT BRING
00:54:27 PEOPLE TOGETHER. THEIR HOSPITALITY ISN'T ABOUT
00:54:31 BUSINESS IT'S ABOUT BELONGING. THEIR WARMTH, HUMOR AND QUIET
00:54:35 GENEROSITY HAS MADE IL PROVIDE A SECOND HOME FOR SO MANY.
00:54:39 TODAY WE GIVE OUR HEARTFELT THANKS TO BILLY COTATI AND HIS
00:54:43 ENTIRE FAMILY FOR THEIR VISION AND LOVE OF PEOPLE.
00:54:49 MAY IL PARADA CONTINUE TO BE A LIGHT IN OUR CITY AND A
00:54:53 REMINDER THAT COMMUNITY THRIVES WHEN WE MAKE ROOM FOR ONE
00:54:57 ANOTHER. THANK YOU BILLY FOR REMINDING
00:54:58 US THAT A NEIGHBORHOOD IS ONLY AS STRONG AS THE PEOPLE WHO
00:55:04 CARE ENOUGH TO KEEP IT TOGETHER.
00:55:08 AND THANK YOU IL PIRATA FOR BEING THAT GATHERING PLACE
00:55:09 AND FOR KEEPING PIETRO HILL'S HEART BEATING.
00:55:15 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> VERY GRATEFUL.

00:59:28 AND OLIVE OIL. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.
00:59:34 WHEN YOU COME HERE YOU FEEL PART OF THE FAMILY

01:04:24 THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WE ARE ABLE TO CONSIDER THIS TODAY
01:04:29 AND ALSO OF COURSE TO GRANT START FOR THEIR MATCH.
01:04:33 AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INVITE TRENT WARD, THE DIRECTOR
01:04:36 OF HCA TO PRESENT. THANK YOU, PRESIDENT GENTLEMEN
01:04:43 ,MEMBERS OF THE BOARD TRENT RAW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HUMAN
01:04:45 SERVICES AGENCY THE 9.1 MILLION WILL BE COUPLED AS PRESIDENT
01:04:51 GENTLEMAN SAID WITH CRYING START FOUNDATIONS GENEROUS
01:04:54 DONATION OF 9.1 MILLION WHICH IS IN THE FORM OF A CONTRACT
01:04:57 BETWEEN THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND THE SAN FRANCISCO
01:04:59 MARIN FOOD BANK FOR THE ENTIRE AMOUNT AND THEN THE FOOD BANK
01:05:06 IN TURN HAS A CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE VENDOR CALLED GOOD CARD
01:05:09 AND GOOD CARD ALONG WITH THE FOOD BANK OPENS A JOINT BANK
01:05:13 ACCOUNT OF THAT AMOUNT FROM WHICH CAL FRESH RECIPIENTS CAN
01:05:18 DRAW THEIR FUNDS WHEN THEY ACTIVATE THEIR GIFT CARDS.
01:05:22 NOW LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH. SO THAT'S THAT'S HOW THE MONEY
01:05:25 WILL BE SPENT. LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH IT WITH
01:05:27 A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AND SORT OF HOW THIS IS GOING
01:05:29 TO WORK. WELL, IT'S ALREADY WORKING
01:05:32 BECAUSE AS OF 11:00 THIS MORNING ONE HUNDRED AND 53
01:05:35 PEOPLE HAVE REDEEMED THEIR GIFT CARDS.
01:05:38 SO AS YOU KNOW BY NOW THE FEDERAL SHUT DOWN.
01:05:42 IT HAS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AFFECTED FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT
01:05:43 PROGRAMS OF WHICH HSA ADMINISTERS IT SPECIFICALLY
01:05:47 HALTING OF FEDERAL MONEY FOR THE CAL FRESH PROGRAM
01:05:50 IN CALIFORNIA AFFECTING OR ESSENTIALLY DELAYING OR NOT
01:05:57 ISSUING BENEFITS AT ALL IN NOVEMBER FOR 82,000
01:06:00 HOUSEHOLDS IN SAN FRANCISCO COMPRISING ABOUT 112,000 PEOPLE
01:06:03 AS I COMMUNICATE TO YOU LAST WEEK IN A MEMO OR A COUPLE OF
01:06:08 WEEKS AGO, THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD BENEFIT IS ABOUT
01:06:10 $275. AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL BENEFIT IS
01:06:12 ABOUT 178 OVER $20 MILLION IN CAL IN FEDERAL CAL FRESH
01:06:16 MONEY GOES TO RECIPIENTS EVERY MONTH IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IS
01:06:19 SPENT IN OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. >> AS YOU ALSO KNOW THE CALPERS
01:06:23 BENEFITS ARE NOT CASH THEY'RE NO LONGER FOOD STAMP COUPONS.
01:06:27 THEY'RE ISSUED ON AN ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER CARD OR ABT
01:06:30 CARD THAT GETS LOADED EVERY MONTH DIRECTLY FROM THE FEDERAL
01:06:33 TREASURY, U.S. TREASURY THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE
01:06:38 IBT VENDOR. I POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE SAN
01:06:39 FRANCISCO HAS NO ROLE IN THAT LOADING OF THE CARD MEANING
01:06:42 THAT WE CANNOT SHOULD WE FIND MONEY ON OUR OWN WE CAN'T
01:06:46 SIMPLY ADD TO THE EXISTING CARD WHICH LIMITED OUR OPTIONS
01:06:50 IN TERMS OF BACKFILLING BENEFITS.
01:06:53 >> SO WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THROUGH
01:06:57 THE MONTH OF OCTOBER THAT THE USDA WAS GOING TO RENEGE ON ITS
01:07:01 PROMISE OVER TIME TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SNAP BENEFITS
01:07:05 NATIONWIDE DUE TO THE SHUTDOWN ,WE PUT TOGETHER A WHOLE SORT
01:07:09 OF A SET OF SCENARIOS MY TEAM DID ALONG WITH THE MAYOR'S
01:07:13 OFFICE TO SORT OF WHAT IF WE HAD $2 MILLION?
01:07:16 WHAT COULD WE DO IF WE HAD 5 MILLION, IF WE HAD 10 MILLION
01:07:18 ETC. PIE IN THE SKY WAS IF WE GOT THE WHOLE 20 MILLION WHAT
01:07:23 WOULD WE DO? >> AND WE WE DECIDED AT THAT
01:07:26 POINT RATHER THAN FUNDING FOOD PANTRIES, THE FOOD BANK
01:07:30 AND OTHER COMMUNITY DISTRIBUTION POINTS WE REALLY
01:07:33 WANTED TO MAINTAIN THAT $20 MILLION THAT'S IN THE LOCAL
01:07:37 ECONOMY AND WE ALSO WANTED TO MAXIMIZE CHOICE FOR OUR OUR
01:07:41 CALPERS CLIENTS. MANY OF THEM WORK GOING TO A
01:07:44 FOOD PANTRY, YOU KNOW, IS IS WAITING IN LINE AND IT'S
01:07:47 DIFFICULT OBVIOUSLY HAVING A GROCERY CARD WHERE THEY CAN
01:07:49 CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT IS PREFERABLE.
01:07:51 WE SET THAT PROPOSAL ON TO THE MAYOR'S OFFICE KUNAL MODY
01:07:56 AND AND PEGGY MARIA HE SHOPPED IT TO TO SEVERAL FUNDERS I
01:08:00 THINK BUT CRANK START STEPPED UP WITH $9.1 MILLION CONTINGENT
01:08:05 ON THE CITY MATCHING THAT 9.1 THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAD
01:08:08 PRESENTED TO THEM IS AS FOLLOWS BECAUSE THE WAY THE CAL FRESH
01:08:13 BENEFITS ARE CALCULATED PRETTY MUCH EVERY EACH OF THE 82,000
01:08:19 HOUSEHOLDS HAS A DIFFERENT BENEFIT AMOUNT BY A LITTLE BIT.
01:08:22 IT'S BASED ON HOUSEHOLD SIZE RENT BURDEN AND HOW MUCH THEY
01:08:23 PAY IN UTILITIES ETC. WE WEREN'T GOING TO ATTEMPT TO
01:08:27 MATCH DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR EACH EACH HOUSEHOLD THAT WOULD HAVE
01:08:30 BEEN ADMINISTRATIVELY IMPOSSIBLE.
01:08:31 >> SO INSTEAD WHAT WE DID IS WE TIERED THE BENEFIT AMOUNT SO A
01:08:37 HOUSEHOLD OF 1 OR 2 PEOPLE WOULD GET $200 IN A GROCERY
01:08:38 CARD, 3 TO 4 WOULD GET 350 AND THEN FIVE OR MORE WOULD GET
01:08:43 500. >> SO IN A SENSE SOME
01:08:47 HOUSEHOLDS MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WHAT THEY WERE
01:08:48 GETTING THROUGH CAL FRESH AND SOME MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT
01:08:50 LESS QUICK START DID FUND THE 9.1 WE'RE HERE BEFORE FOR THE
01:08:57 SUPPLEMENTAL TO DRAW FROM THE RESERVE FOR THE OTHER 9.1 WE
01:09:00 GOT WORD THIS WAS A SPRINT LAST MONDAY AND FROM MONDAY OF LAST
01:09:07 WEEK TO FRIDAY THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY DRAFTED ALONG
01:09:12 WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE A CONTRACT A SOLE SOURCE
01:09:14 CONTRACT FOR $18.2 MILLION, A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT BECAUSE
01:09:18 THE COVERAGE DATA NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED.
01:09:19 SO THAT WAS WITH WITH THE VENDOR GOOD CARD.
01:09:22 >> I SIGNED THE CONTRACT AT 3 P.M. ON FRIDAY.
01:09:26 WE WORKED THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH CITY REPRODUCTION AND THE
01:09:29 CITY MAIL TO AMOUNT TO TO PRINT AND MAIL OUT 82,000 INDIVIDUAL
01:09:34 LETTERS TO EACH HOUSEHOLD WHO ARE RECOVERIES RECIPIENTS
01:09:38 IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE EACH OF THOSE LETTERS CONTAIN AN
01:09:41 ACTIVATION CODE SPECIFIC TO THAT HOUSEHOLD WITH THAT ALLOWS
01:09:45 THEM TO ACTIVATE THEIR VIRTUAL GIFT CARD USING THAT CODE ALONG
01:09:50 WITH SOME PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WHICH I'M NOT GOING
01:09:54 TO SPECIFY HERE JUST SORT OF FRAUD PROTECTION BUT THEY HAVE
01:09:57 TO VERIFY THAT IT'S THE PERSON ON THE LETTER AND THAT THEY ARE
01:10:01 BENEFITS OF OR RECIPIENTS OF CAL FRESH RECIPIENTS ALSO HAVE
01:10:07 AN OPTION FOR A PHYSICAL CARD THEY CAN CONTACT THE CALL
01:10:11 CENTER FOR GIFT CARD THEY COULD GET ISSUED A PHYSICAL CARD
01:10:16 AND IT WOULD BE MAILED WITHIN 5 TO 7 BUSINESS DAYS OF 100
01:10:21 AND 50 OR SO WHO HAVE ACTIVATED SO FAR 52% OF THEM CHOSE THE
01:10:22 VIRTUAL ROUTE. THE REMAINDER OF CHOSE THE
01:10:25 PHYSICAL CARD. THE VIRTUAL ONE SIMPLY GOES ON
01:10:28 YOUR YOUR APPLE PAY OR YOUR GOOGLE WALLET OR OR WHATEVER WE
01:10:32 HAVE PROVIDED TOOLKITS TO CBOS TO HELP CLIENTS NAVIGATE THAT
01:10:38 ACTIVATION SHOULD THEY HAVE QUESTIONS?
01:10:42 SENIOR CENTERS FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS ARE HOMELESS SHELTERS
01:10:43 OR NAVIGATION CENTERS. IN ADDITION, AS I SAID, GOOD
01:10:49 CARD HAS A18 HUNDRED NUMBER FOR A CALL CENTER BECAUSE THERE
01:10:50 MIGHT BE CAPACITY ISSUES WE HAVE LINKED TO THEIR CALL
01:10:54 CENTER SO OVERFLOW CALLS NOW FLOW INTO THE HUMAN SERVICES
01:10:57 AGENCY'S BENEFIT CENTER SERVICE CENTER TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE.
01:11:01 >> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BOTH GOOD CARD
01:11:05 AND THE FOOD BANK ARE DOING THIS WORK PRO BONO.
01:11:08 GOOD CARD WILL CHARGE $5 FOR EACH PHYSICAL CARD THAT THEY
01:11:12 HAVE TO MAIL AND THAT'S JUST COVERING THEIR COSTS.
01:11:15 >> IF ALL 82,000 HOUSEHOLDS REQUESTED A PHYSICAL CARD IT
01:11:19 WOULD COST US $410,000 WHICH IN TERMS OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE
01:11:22 TOTAL IS VERY SMALL, WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERYONE WILL NEED
01:11:26 THAT THAT PHYSICAL CARD. >> HOW WILL CLIENTS FIND OUT?
01:11:30 A LOT OF CLIENTS MIGHT NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THEIR CARD WILL BE
01:11:34 LOADED BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL SHUTDOWN.
01:11:36 SO WE SENT AS I SAID, 82,000 LETTERS THIS MORNING OVER
01:11:40 90,000 TEXT MESSAGES WENT OUT TO 112,000 CONFERENCE
01:11:43 RECIPIENTS INFORMING THEM THAT THEIR BENEFITS WILL BE DELAYED
01:11:46 AND THAT THEY SHOULD EXPECT A LETTER REGARDING THE GROCERY
01:11:50 CARD IN THE MAIL. >> THE GROCERY CARD CAN ONLY BE
01:11:51 USED AT POINT OF SALE MACHINES IN GROCERY STORES, MARKETS FOR
01:11:58 FOOD OR FOR PREPARED MEALS. >> WARM MEALS THAT ARE PREPARED
01:12:03 CAN'T BE USED IN RESTAURANTS, CAN'T BE USED FOR ALCOHOL,
01:12:06 CAN'T BE USED FOR TOBACCO, ALSO CANNOT BE CONVERTED TO CASH.
01:12:10 YOU CAN'T GET MONEY OUT OF AN ATM.
01:12:11 YOU CAN'T USE IT TO TRANSFER MONEY INTO INTO A CHECKING
01:12:12 ACCOUNT. >> LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE.
01:12:17 OH REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE THAT THAT WE SORT OF STRUGGLE
01:12:20 THROUGH BUT WE THINK WE HAVE A AS ELEGANT A SOLUTION AS
01:12:24 POSSIBLE FOR OUR CALPERS CLIENTS WHO DON'T HAVE A FIXED
01:12:27 ADDRESS. WE HAVE ABOUT 8000 RECIPIENTS
01:12:30 WHO USE WHAT'S CALLED GENERAL DELIVERY WHICH IS THE POST
01:12:33 OFFICE ON HIGH STREET TO GET THEIR CORRESPONDENCE FROM US.
01:12:37 ABOUT 85% OF THEM ARE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.
01:12:40 WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR THEM AGAIN THEY CAN ACTIVATE THE
01:12:42 CARDS VIRTUALLY WITHOUT EVEN A LETTER PROVIDED THAT THEY HAVE
01:12:46 THEIR THEIR IB CARD NUMBER AND THEIR IDENTIFIABLE
01:12:48 INFORMATION TO PROVE IT TO THEM.
01:12:49 >> BUT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO OPEN UP OUR OFFICES, OUR
01:12:53 DISTRIBUTION OFFICES AT 1235 MISSION STREET MISSION BETWEEN
01:12:57 EIGHTH AND NINTH STARTING THURSDAY TO GIVE ACTIVATE
01:13:02 AND PROVIDE PHYSICAL CARDS TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING
01:13:04 HOMELESSNESS OR OTHERS WHO USE THE GENERAL DELIVERY ADDRESS.
01:13:07 >> WE ARE PARTNERING WITH CODE TENDERLOIN WHOSE OFFICES ARE
01:13:10 LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT DOOR THAT WE SHARE A WALL AND THEY'RE
01:13:13 OPENING AN ADDITIONAL SIX DESKS KIOSKS IF YOU WILL, TO HELP
01:13:17 INDIVIDUALS. >> WE'RE UNDER NO ILLUSIONS
01:13:21 THIS IS 8000 PEOPLE. THERE ARE GOING TO BE LINES
01:13:23 DOWN MISSION STREET. WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE
01:13:25 CAN TO MITIGATE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE CODE
01:13:26 TENDERLOIN WINDOWS WE HAVE FOUR WINDOWS AT EIGHT TO SAY WE WILL

01:13:45 THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A PHYSICAL CARD.
01:13:47 AGAIN THAT BEGINS ON ON THURSDAY.
01:13:51 THAT'S SORT OF IT FOR THE YOU KNOW, THE OVERVIEW I DO HAVE TO
01:13:58 SAY THAT THIS IS A HERCULEAN EFFORT ON NOT JUST BY HSA STAFF

01:14:05 MODI AND PEGGY MORIARITY AND ALSO ADAM SAN FRANCISCO
01:14:06 MARIN FOOD BANK AND THEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TANNIS

01:14:15 MILLION, $15 MILLION COULD YOU EXPAND YOUR PANTRIES?
01:14:17 SHE SAID SURE. WHEN WE DECIDED TO GO A
01:14:21 DIFFERENT DIRECTION WITH THE CARDS CALLED TANNIS AND SHE
01:14:23 SAID NO PROBLEM WILL BE THE INTERMEDIARY AND YOU KNOW, THEY

01:14:42 POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR SORT OF THE FRAUD SAFEGUARDS
01:14:46 THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE SO
01:14:49 HSA HAS OUR OWN PRINTING AND MAILING CAPACITY.
01:14:54 WE MAILED OUT NOTICES TO OUR 250,000 CLIENTS ON A REGULAR
01:14:57 BASIS. OF COURSE LAST WEEK ON
01:15:00 WEDNESDAY TWO OF OUR PRINTERS COPIERS WERE DOWN.

01:15:07 TO SAY THAT THEY WILL HELP BUT WHEN I SAID THAT WE NEEDED THEM
01:15:11 TO WORK THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND THAT HSA WOULD PAY FOR
01:15:12 THEIR OVERTIME, SHE GOT BACK TO ME WITHIN A HALF HOUR AND SAID
01:15:16 HER STAFF WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH THE WEEK
01:15:18 THROUGH THE HALLOWEEN WEEKEND TO GET THOSE LETTERS OUT
01:15:19 AND THEY WENT OUT MONDAY AROUND 6 P.M. H.S. DEPARTMENT OF
01:15:26 HOMELESSNESS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING USE THROUGH THEIR
01:15:27 COMMUNITY NETWORKS. >> ALL OF THEIR CBO PARTNERS
01:15:30 DROP IN CENTER SHELTERS TO GET THE WORD OUT TO PEOPLE

01:15:35 HSA WORKED TIRELESSLY FROM OUR I.T. CONTRACTS, COMMUNICATIONS
01:15:39 PLANNING AND POLICY LED THE EFFORT.
01:15:42 IT WAS REALLY AN AMAZING UNDERTAKING AND AND JUST HAVE
01:15:46 TO SAY I'M VERY PROUD OF NOT ONLY MY STAFF BUT THE WAY THE
01:15:50 CITY STEPPED UP TO MEET THE FOOD NEEDS OF 82,000 PEOPLE WHO
01:15:53 OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN BY THE FEDERAL
01:15:54 GOVERNMENT. SO I'LL CONCLUDE WITH THAT
01:15:57 AND OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

01:23:11 THANK YOU MADAM CLERK. COLLEAGUES, I WANT TO PRESENT
01:23:15 AN IN MEMORIAM IN HONOR OF KIT KAT THE BELOVED BODEGA CAT WHO
01:23:19 WAS ADOPTED BY MY SAID IN THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF RANDY'S
01:23:23 MARKET ON 16TH STREET IN THE MISSION KIT KAT WAS STRUCK
01:23:27 AND KILLED BY A WAYMO ROBOTAXI LAST MONDAY IN A TRAGIC
01:23:30 INCIDENT. IT'S ACTUALLY KNOWN AS MAYOR OF
01:23:33 16TH STREET. >> KIT KAT ARRIVED AT THE
01:23:34 MARKET SIX YEARS AGO AND SINCE THEN BECAME A NEIGHBORHOOD
01:23:37 FIXTURE AND A TRUE ICON OF 16TH STREET A FAMILIAR FELINE FACE
01:23:41 EVERY PERSON THAT WALKS BY OR INTO THE MARKET, KIT KAT WOULD
01:23:45 CALMLY GREET CINEPHILES AS THEY LEFT THE ROXY OR PATRONS FROM
01:23:49 DARVA AND DELIRIUM ALWAYS READY FOR LOVING PETS FROM REGULARS
01:23:55 AND NEW VISITORS ALIKE ONE OF THE KIND CAT IT WOULD NOT BE AN
01:23:57 OVERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT ANYONE WHO EVER SPENT ANY TIME
01:24:00 ON THE ICONIC 16TH STREET CORRIDOR IN THE MISSION KNEW OF
01:24:02 KIT KAT. HE REPRESENTED EVERY THING THAT
01:24:06 MAKES THE MISSION DISTRICT SPECIAL.
01:24:06 HE WAS FRIENDLY, BRAVE AND DEEPLY ROOTED IN HIS
01:24:10 COMMUNITY. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATED SEEING
01:24:13 HIM WHENEVER I WOULD GO TO THE ROXY DAUBER ANY OF THE
01:24:17 WONDERFUL RESTAURANTS AND BARS ON THAT STREET.
01:24:20 KIT KAT AND OUR PETS ARE LIVING CREATURES WITH INHERENT VALUE
01:24:25 THAT DESERVE DIGNITY AND OUR RESPECT.
01:24:28 IF THE MEASURE OF ANY SOCIETY IS IN THE WAY IT TREATS THOSE
01:24:30 WHO ARE THE WEAKEST THEN KIT KAT DEATH DESERVES OUR SORROW.
01:24:33 OUR REVERENCE AND OUR REGRET AND THIS INCIDENT THAT RESULTED
01:24:39 IN KIT COUNT'S TRAGIC DEATH DESERVES JUST AS MUCH SCRUTINY
01:24:40 AND ATTENTION AS A DEATH OF ANY OTHER.
01:24:44 AND A FRIEND THAT POPPED UP OUTSIDE OF RANDY'S MARKET
01:24:47 IN THE DAYS AFTER KIT KATS PASSING WITH HUNDREDS OF
01:24:50 OFFERINGS FROM THE MANY LIVES HE HAS TOUCHED THE OUTPOURING
01:24:55 OF SUPPORT, THE COUNTLESS STORIES AND MANY, MANY MEMORIES
01:24:58 WITH KIT KAT ARE A TESTAMENT TO JUST HOW VITAL HIS ROLE ON 16TH
01:25:02 STREET WAS AND THE JOY THAT HE BROUGHT TO PEOPLE'S LIVES.
01:25:06 >> THE MISSION WILL NOT BE THE SAME WITHOUT OUR KIT KAT
01:25:07 HOWEVER HIS MEMORY AND LEGACY LIVE ON IN OUR HEARTS REST
01:25:11 IN PEACE. AND ON THAT NOTE I AM ALSO
01:25:20 INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION TODAY CALLING ON THE CALIFORNIA
01:25:24 LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO GIVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE
01:25:27 POWER TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
01:25:31 SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE ON THE ROADS.
01:25:33 STATE LAW FIRST AUTHORIZED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON PUBLIC
01:25:36 ROADS IN 2012 AND LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE
01:25:38 CONSIDERED SB 915 WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED MUNICIPAL
01:25:41 GOVERNMENTS SOME CONTROL OVER THEIR DEPLOYMENT.
01:25:44 >> THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN MARCH OF 2024 UNANIMOUSLY
01:25:48 PASSED A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THAT BILL.
01:25:51 UNFORTUNATELY THAT BILL DID NOT PASS IN PART DUE TO CONCERNS
01:25:55 ABOUT MAINTAINING INTERCITY CONSISTENCY.
01:25:56 >> SINCE THEN THE PROLIFERATION OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN SAN
01:26:00 FRANCISCO HAS CONTINUED TO RAISE SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY
01:26:03 WORKFORCE ENVIRONMENTAL TRAFFIC AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
01:26:08 CONCERNS. THIS RESOLUTION PROPOSES A PATH
01:26:12 FORWARD RATHER THAN LEAVING CITIES POWERLESS.
01:26:13 >> IT CALLS ON THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO
01:26:17 GRANT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THE RIGHT TO
01:26:21 DECIDE WHETHER AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES SHOULD OPERATE WITHIN
01:26:24 THEIR JURISDICTIONS. BY DOING SO WE CAN PROMOTE MORE
01:26:25 LOCAL DEMOCRACY, ENSURE REGIONAL COORDINATION AND GIVE
01:26:29 COMMUNITIES A REAL VOICE IN SHAPING THE FUTURE OF OUR
01:26:33 TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. I WANT TO THANK SUPERVISORS
01:26:37 CHAN CHEN AND WALTON FOR YOUR EARLY CO-SPONSORSHIP.
01:26:40 LET'S SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO SACRAMENTO.
01:26:41 LOCAL COMMUNITIES DESERVE A SAY IN WHETHER AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
01:26:45 OPERATE ON OUR STREETS. THE REST I SUBMIT.
01:26:48 >> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR FIELDER SUPERVISOR
01:26:49 MAHMOOD. >> COLLEAGUES LAST WEEK I SPOKE
01:26:54 ABOUT HOW THE NEWS OF A POTENTIAL NATIONAL GUARD SURGE
01:26:58 LEFT MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS FEELING ANXIOUS AND UNCERTAIN
01:27:02 ABOUT WHAT COMES NEXT IN OUR CITY.
01:27:03 >> AS REPRESENTATIVES FOR OUR DISTRICTS IT IS OUR JOB TO DO
01:27:06 EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO KEEP OUR RESIDENTS SAFE AND AT EASE.
01:27:10 IN FACT, SAN FRANCISCO'S LONG PRIDED ITSELF ON BEING A
01:27:14 SANCTUARY CITY A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF
01:27:17 BACKGROUND OR IMMIGRATION STATUS KNOWS THEY BELONG
01:27:21 AND TRUSTS THAT THEY ARE WELCOME.
01:27:25 >> IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE'VE HEARD QUESTIONS FROM COMMUNITY
01:27:29 ABOUT THE NATIONAL GUARD. SO TODAY I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY A
01:27:33 FEW POINTS. >> I'M INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION
01:27:36 RECOGNIZING THAT OUR SANCTUARY CITY ORDINANCE STILL STANDS
01:27:38 STRONG AND PROHIBITS THE USE OF CITY RESOURCES TO ASSIST ANY
01:27:44 FEDERALLY DEPLOYED NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL OR OTHER
01:27:45 FEDERAL AGENTS ENGAGED IN CIVIL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.
01:27:49 >> IT IS A REAFFIRMATION OF THE CITY'S ENDURING COMMITMENT TO
01:27:53 SUPPORT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES BECAUSE SANCTUARY POLICIES
01:27:57 EMBODY OUR VALUES OF INCLUSION, DIGNITY AND THE RIGHTS OF ALL
01:28:04 PEOPLE TO LIVE FREE FROM DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT OR
01:28:08 INTIMIDATION REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS.
01:28:12 >> THIS POLICY HAS SET THE MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE
01:28:14 NATION FOR DECADES AND I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THESE
01:28:17 SANCTUARY PROTECTIONS APPLY EQUALLY TO ANY FEDERAL ENTITY
01:28:20 CONDUCTING CIVIL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WHETHER IT'S ICE
01:28:27 FEDERALIZED NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS OR OTHER AGENCIES LIKE
01:28:31 THE DEA AND ATF THAT COULD BE TAPPED FOR CIVIL IMMIGRATION
01:28:35 ENFORCEMENT. >> OUR CITY RESOURCES WILL NOT
01:28:39 BE USED TO ASSIST IN CIVIL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.
01:28:42 >> I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE. WHAT OUR RESIDENTS WANT MOST IS
01:28:47 TO FEEL SAFE, TO FEEL PROTECTED AND TO KNOW THAT THE CITY HAS
01:28:50 THEIR BACK. >> SO TO OUR RESIDENTS WHO ARE
01:28:52 WATCHING, WE STAND WITH OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES.
01:28:56 WE STAND WITH RESIDENTS AGAINST FEAR AND DISCRIMINATION AND WE
01:28:59 WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR RESIDENTS SAFE NO MATTER WHAT
01:29:03 COMES OUR WAY. I'D LIKE TO THANK S.F. RISING
01:29:07 AND IRAQ FOR SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION.
01:29:10 AND THANKS TO OUR DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY BRAD ROSSI AND MY
01:29:11 CHIEF OF STAFF JESSICA GUTIERREZ GARCIA AND MOST
01:29:14 IMPORTANTLY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR SAM LOGAN FOR WORKING
01:29:18 IN OUR OFFICE ON THIS LEGISLATION.

01:34:41 >> SUPERVISOR MELGAR. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK.
01:34:44 COLLEAGUES TODAY I AM SUBMITTING A LETTER OF INQUIRY
01:34:48 TO THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.
01:34:52 >> ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE DISTRICT TEN SUPERVISOR SHERMAN
01:34:56 WALTON REGARDING BIRTH OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL
01:35:00 HEALTH WE HAVE GREAT DISPARITIES IN OUR CITY WHEN IT
01:35:04 COMES TO BIRTH OUTCOMES. HEARTBREAKING, INEXCUSABLE
01:35:07 DISPARITIES. ALL BABIES AND THEIR MOMS
01:35:11 DESERVE A CHANCE TO THRIVE IN OUR CITY AND HAVE THE ACCESS
01:35:14 THAT THEY NEED TO RESOURCES TO ENSURE THEIR SUCCESS.
01:35:18 THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF EQUITY AND IT IS OUR MORAL IMPERATIVE.
01:35:23 OVER THE YEARS A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SUPPORTED FUNDING
01:35:28 FOR MATERNAL HEALTH. >> DESPITE THAT WE ARE STILL
01:35:31 FALLING BEHIND OTHER COUNTIES. >> WE HAVE THE HIGHEST PRETERM
01:35:35 BIRTH RATE FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS AND IN CERTAIN ZIP
01:35:38 CODES IN CALIFORNIA. WE WOULD LIKE A BETTER
01:35:42 UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED AND EXPANDED.
01:35:46 I WAS ALSO DISMAYED TO LEARN FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO STANDARD
01:35:49 STANDARD THAT THERE IS FUNDING ABOUT 800,000 THROUGH THE
01:35:53 STATE'S PRENATAL PRENATAL EQUITY INITIATIVE THAT WE ARE
01:35:56 SENDING BACK TO THE STATE AND THERE IS AT LEAST $8
01:36:02 MILLION IN UNDER SPENDING TO ADDRESS MATERNAL INEQUITIES.
01:36:07 THIS IS MORALLY INEXCUSABLE AND WE MUST ACT NOW.
01:36:10 LET'S CHERISH OUR BABIES. LET'S SUPPORT OUR MAMAS.
01:36:14 LET'S HOLD THIS DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR SETTING THE
01:36:18 FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH EQUITY IN OUR CITY.
01:36:19 THIS IS A SOLVABLE PROBLEM. THE REST I SUBMIT.
01:36:26 THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MELGAR.
01:36:27 SUPERVISOR SAUTER SUBMIT. >> THANK YOU.
01:36:30 SUPERVISOR CHERYL. COLLEAGUES.
01:36:33 TODAY I'M INTRODUCING AN ORDINANCE TO SUPPORT THE
01:36:35 OPERATIONS OF OUR BELOVED MOVIE THEATERS CITYWIDE.
01:36:38 >> AS WE ALL KNOW, MOVIE THEATERS ARE ESSENTIAL PIECE OF
01:36:42 OUR CULTURAL FABRIC. >> THEY'RE COMMUNITY
01:36:45 CORNERSTONES GATHERING SPACES AND THEY SERVE A SPECIAL ROLE
01:36:49 IN BRINGING NEIGHBORHOODS TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE ARTS.
01:36:50 OUR FILM FESTIVALS SUCH AS FRAME LINE, THE WORLD'S LARGEST
01:36:54 LGBTQ PLUS FILM FESTIVAL AS A FILM AND OTHERS NOT ONLY
01:36:57 REFLECT THE STRENGTH OF SAN FRANCISCO'S DIVERSITY, THEY
01:37:01 ALSO GIVE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ARTISTS WHO ARE UNWELCOME
01:37:02 OR UNCELEBRATED ELSEWHERE. YET OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
01:37:05 DECADES MOVIE THEATERS HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY SHIFTING
01:37:09 STREAMING HABITS THE PANDEMICS AND MORE.
01:37:12 >> AND THE THEATERS HAVE BEEN HIT HARDEST BY THESE TOUGH
01:37:13 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR THE SMALL SINGLE SCREEN HISTORIC
01:37:17 THEATERS MANY OF WHICH WERE SMALL BUSINESSES AND BEEN
01:37:21 FORCED TO CLOSE IN RECENT YEARS .
01:37:24 NOW IN DISTRICT TWO WE HAVE A LANDMARK THEATER THE CLAY
01:37:25 THEATER THAT I'M VERY EXCITED TO SAY WILL BE THOUGHTFULLY
01:37:28 RESTORED AND WILL REOPEN AS A THEATER NEXT YEAR.
01:37:32 >> BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT SERVING BEER AND WINE AT
01:37:36 THEATERS IS GOOD FOR THE BOTTOM LINE.
01:37:39 IT'S GOOD FOR LONG TERM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY AS
01:37:41 BUSINESSES. AND WHEN I MET WITH THE PROJECT
01:37:43 SPONSORS AT THE CLAY THEATER THEY LET ME KNOW THAT OUR
01:37:45 PLANNING CODE TREATS MOVIE THEATERS WOULD LIKE TO SERVE
01:37:48 BEER AND WINE THE SAME AS RESTAURANTS AND WE LEVY THE
01:37:50 SAME PUNISHMENTS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE SPECIFICALLY
01:37:52 STATE LIQUOR LAWS MANDATE THAT MOVIE THEATERS WANT TO SERVE
01:37:55 BEER AND WINE, OPERATE A RESTAURANT IN CONJUNCTION
01:37:58 AND THEN OUR PLANNING CODE IMPLEMENTS THE SAME REVENUE
01:37:59 TEST ON THESE MOVIE THEATERS THAT WE PLACE ON RESTAURANTS
01:38:03 MEANING THAT THESE THEATERS WILL HAVE TO MAKE A MINIMUM OF
01:38:06 51% OF THEIR GROSS RECEIPTS FROM FOOD SALES PREPARED
01:38:09 AND SOLD TO GUESTS. SO IN PRACTICE WE ARE MANDATING
01:38:12 THAT ANY COMMUNITY THEATER ESPECIALLY THE NEWLY RENOVATED
01:38:16 CLAY THEATER SERVING BEER AND WINE MAKE AT LEAST 51% OF
01:38:19 THEIR REVENUE FROM FOOD THAT THEY PREPARE ON SITE
01:38:22 AND REGARDLESS HOW MUCH WE CHARGE FOR EXTRA BUTTER NO
01:38:24 AMOUNT OF POPCORN IS GOING TO MAKE 51% OF THEIR REVENUE.
01:38:28 THIS IS A TIME WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER TO INVEST IN AND
01:38:33 OPERATE THESE COMMUNITIES SPACES.
01:38:35 >> SO THIS ORDINANCE AMENDS THE PLAN AND GOES DEFINITION OF
01:38:39 MOVIE THEATER IN SECTION 102 TO ALLOW THEATERS TO PROVIDE
01:38:40 ONSITE BEER AND WINE FOR DRINKING ON PREMISES WITH AN
01:38:44 ABC LICENSE AND ONLY AS A MINOR AND INCIDENTAL USE.
01:38:48 WE NEED TO BE ENCOURAGING RESIDENTS TO GO TO THEIR
01:38:50 NEIGHBORHOOD THEATER TO WALK THEIR LOCAL MERCHANT COURT OR
01:38:51 TO SUPPORT THE ARTS IN THIS CITY.
01:38:54 >> AND THIS LEGISLATION WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT MOVIE
01:38:55 THEATERS ARE NOT THE SAME AS RESTAURANTS.
01:38:58 AND OUR PLANNING CODE SHOULDN'T TREAT THEM THE SAME.
01:39:00 IT WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN IN CITY HALL
01:39:02 TO BE A PARTNER AND A SUPPORTER OF OUR MOVIE THEATERS AND OF
01:39:05 THE ARTS. >> AND WHILE I'M PARTICULARLY
01:39:06 THRILLED TO STOP BY FOR A MOVIE AND ALSO POSSIBLY SOME SUNDAY
01:39:10 MORNING CARTOONS AT THE REOPEN CLAY THEATER IN THE COMING YEAR
01:39:14 OR SO, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FIX THIS ILLOGICAL REQUIREMENT
01:39:18 FOR ALL OUR THEATERS CITYWIDE TO BENEFIT BY ENACTING THIS
01:39:22 ORDINANCE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR ALL THEATERS BUT
01:39:23 PARTICULARLY OUR SMALL BUSINESSES, OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY
01:39:27 THEATERS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS CHERISHED CULTURAL
01:39:30 CORNERSTONES. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND THEIR
01:39:34 ASSESSMENT. >> THANK YOU.
01:39:35 SUPERVISOR SHERYL SUPERVISOR WALTON.
01:39:37 >> THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. COLLEAGUES, FIRST I JUST WANT
01:39:40 TO ADD TO THE LETTER OF INQUIRY BY SUPERVISOR MELGAR AND JUST
01:39:45 STATE A REMINDER THAT IN 2020 SUPERVISOR FEWER ADDED $2
01:39:51 MILLION TO ADDRESS BLACK INFANT MORTALITY.
01:39:55 THERE WERE MANY REASONS WHY THIS WAS IMPORTANT AND TODAY WE
01:39:59 WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS AND THE CHANGES THAT
01:40:01 HAVE TAKEN PLACE TO LOWER THESE NATIONAL STATISTICS.
01:40:04 WE WERE ALL IN RECEIPT OF A LETTER SIGNED BY DOCTORS
01:40:08 AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING MATERNAL HEALTH
01:40:12 WHO ARE TELLING US THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAS THE WORST BIRTH
01:40:15 DISPARITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
01:40:19 BLACK MOTHERS REPRESENT ONLY 4% OF BIRTHS IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT
01:40:23 ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 50% OF MATERNAL DEATHS WHICH IS FIVE
01:40:27 OUT OF TEN OVER THE LAST DECADE.
01:40:28 SO NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND WE WILL ALSO
01:40:32 BE HOSTING A HEARING ON THIS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.
01:40:35 >> TODAY I'M ALSO FORMALLY REQUESTING A HEARING ON THE
01:40:40 UNITED STATES NAVY'S DELAYED DISCLOSURE OF AIRBORNE
01:40:44 PLUTONIUM DETECTED AT HUNTERS POINT SHIPYARD.
01:40:48 THE NAVY IDENTIFIED PLUTONIUM ABOVE THE ALLOWABLE LEVEL
01:40:52 IN NOVEMBER OF 2024 ON PARCEL G AND DID NOT REPORT IT TO THE
01:40:55 CITY UNTIL OCTOBER OF 2025. RECENTLY ALMOST A YEAR DELAY OF
01:41:03 NEARLY ONE YEAR FOR INFORMATION THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE
01:41:07 PUBLIC HEALTH. >> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
01:41:10 UNACCEPTABLE AND CANNOT BE EXCUSED OR MINIMIZE.
01:41:14 DISTRICT TEN IN THIS COMMUNITY HAS ENDURED DECADES OF BROKEN
01:41:15 PROMISES AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND DELAYED
01:41:18 DISCLOSURES FROM THE NAVY. THIS IS THE LATEST INCIDENT
01:41:22 THAT PROVES THAT THE NAVY CONTINUES TO HIDE INFORMATION
01:41:26 INSTEAD OF COMMUNICATING HONESTLY WITH THE BABY HUNTERS
01:41:30 POINT RESIDENTS AND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
01:41:34 >> I AM REQUESTING THE US NAVY ,THE EPA, CALIFORNIA
01:41:38 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE SAN FRANCISCO
01:41:41 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PROVIDE EVERY DOCUMENT, EVERY
01:41:45 TEST RESULT AND EVERY EXPLANATION FOR THIS FAILURE
01:41:48 AND TO OUTLINE WHAT PROTECTIONS IF ANY WERE IN PLACE DURING THE
01:41:53 11 MONTHS THE PUBLIC WAS KEPT IN THE DARK.
01:41:56 THE PEOPLE BEHIND THIS POINT DESERVE TRANSPARENCY, NOT MORE
01:42:00 EXCUSES. OUR OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO
01:42:01 FIGHT FOR FULL ACCOUNTABILITY INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT, FULL
01:42:05 CLEANUP TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS WORKERS, THE PEOPLE
01:42:09 THAT LIVE AROUND AND THE ARTISTS ON THE SHIPYARD
01:42:15 AND COLLEAGUES. >> LAST I AM REQUESTING A
01:42:16 LETTER OF INQUIRY TO THE FOLLOWING DEPARTMENTS THE
01:42:20 MAYOR'S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELESSNESS AND SUPPORTIVE
01:42:24 HOUSING SAN FRANCISCO, ALL MTA, SAN FRANCISCO PORT AND THE
01:42:28 DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ON WHY THEY CONTINUE
01:42:32 TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT OVERTLY BURDEN DISTRICT TEN
01:42:38 COMMUNITIES. RIGHT NOW THIS ADMINISTRATION
01:42:39 CONTINUES TO STRONG ARM THE DISTRICT TEN COMMUNITY AND IS
01:42:43 ENSURING THAT DISTRICT TEN IS SHOULDERING MANY OF THE HEAVY
01:42:47 BURDENS OF HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER ISSUES FOR THE CITY.
01:42:52 DISTRICT TEN CONTINUES TO CARRY MORE THAN OUR SHARE OF THE
01:42:54 CITY'S BURDENS. WE SHOW UP FOR SOLUTIONS BUT WE
01:42:57 SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE USED TO SHOULDER ALL THE BURDENS.
01:43:01 TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE RV ENFORCEMENT PLAN WAS ENACTED ON
01:43:07 NOVEMBER 1ST AND NOW THE CITY IS PREPARING TO TOW PEOPLE'S
01:43:10 HOMES AND MOVE THEM TO PIER 68 IN DISTRICT TEN.
01:43:14 WITH THE COURT'S PERMISSION AND A SECRET DEAL THAT NO ONE
01:43:17 WAS AWARE WAS TAKING PLACE, THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO QUIETLY
01:43:21 MOVE A SELF-CREATED PROBLEM INTO OUR COMMUNITY WITHOUT ANY
01:43:25 TRANSPARENCY OR ANY COMMUNITY INPUT WHATSOEVER.
01:43:30 >> THAT IS NOT STRATEGY. THAT IS DISPLACEMENT.
01:43:33 WE HAVE SEEN THIS PATTERN ALREADY.
01:43:37 >> TINY CABINS WERE SECRETLY MOVED FROM THE MISSION TO OUR
01:43:41 GERALD STREET SITE RECENTLY WITHOUT ANY COMMUNITY INPUT
01:43:45 AFTER PLANS FOR THE ORIGINAL SITE WERE CHANGED MULTIPLE
01:43:48 TIMES AGAIN WITHOUT COMMUNITY INPUT.
01:43:52 NOW THE CITY AT THE PUSHING OF MTA WANTS TO STORE TOWED RVS AT
01:43:59 PIER 68 WITH NO TRANSPARENCY, NO NOTICE AND NO RESPECT.
01:44:03 FAMILIES, SENIORS AND WORKING PEOPLE LIVE, WORK AND GATHER
01:44:07 AROUND THEIR. WE ARE NOT THE CITY STORAGE
01:44:11 YARD. WHEN OTHER COMMUNITIES DO NOT
01:44:14 WANT TO DEAL WITH HARD PROBLEMS IF THIS PLAN IS SAFE, EQUITABLE
01:44:18 AND EFFECTIVE THEN IT SHOULD BE SHARED ACROSS THE CITY AND NOT
01:44:22 DROPPED IN DISTRICT TEN AS A SECRET.
01:44:25 >> I'M CALLING FOR TRANSPARENCY, EQUITY AND REAL
01:44:28 HOUSING SOLUTIONS. SHOW US THE PLAN.
01:44:29 ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY. STOP CONCENTRATING THE CITY'S
01:44:33 BURDENS THAT CREATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS IN DISTRICT TEN.
01:44:37 JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FAMILIES, PEOPLE
01:44:41 AND COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTHEAST SECTOR OF SAN
01:44:44 FRANCISCO, DISTRICT TEN WILL NOT BE THE CITY'S DUMPING
01:44:48 GROUND. >> TIME AFTER TIME I WANT TO
01:44:51 KNOW WHY THIS ADMINISTRATION IS BENT ON IGNORING D10
01:44:55 COMMUNITIES. I WANT THESE DEPARTMENTS TO
01:44:58 EXPLAIN WHY THEY FEEL THEY CAN IGNORE COMMUNITY VOICE
01:44:59 AND THEIR DECISION MAKING AND PUT ON RECORD WHAT THEY
01:45:03 HAVE AGAINST DISTRICT TEN AND HOW THEY MAKE THESE
01:45:06 DECISIONS. FURTHERMORE, S.F. MTA SHOULD BE
01:45:10 TRYING TO BRING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER AT A TIME WHEN THEY
01:45:14 ARE GOING TO BE ASKING THE VOTERS TO ADDRESS THEIR MANY
01:45:17 FISCAL ISSUES. IF S.F. MTA DOESN'T SUPPORT US,
01:45:21 WHY SHOULD WE SUPPORT THEM? >> THE REST I SUBMIT.
01:45:25 THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR WALTON.

01:49:01 ME AND STOOD WITH ME BUT ALL MEN FORSOOK ME EVEN LUKE.
01:49:08 I PRAY GOD THAT IT MAY NOT BE LAID TO THEIR CHARGE
01:49:12 NOTWITHSTANDING THE LORD STOOD WITH ME AND STRENGTHENED ME
01:49:13 THAT BY ME THE PREACHING MIGHT BE FULLY KNOWN AND THAT ALL THE
01:49:17 GENTILES MIGHT HEAR AND I WAS DELIVERED OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
01:49:20 THE LION REFERRING TO NERO AS THE LION AND THE LORD SHALL
01:49:24 DELIVER ME FROM EVERY EVIL WORK AND WILL PRESERVE ME UNTO HIS
01:49:28 HEAVENLY KINGDOM TO WHOM BE GLORY FOREVER AND EVER.
01:49:31 AMEN. AND THEN HE WAS DECAPITATED.
01:49:35 NOW THIS THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW IF YOU'RE SAVED
01:49:38 YOU ARE SAVED BY GRACE NOT BY YOUR WORKS.
01:49:42 >> OKAY. THERE WASN'T ONE CHRISTIAN THAT
01:49:43 STOOD WITH PAUL, NOT ONE CHRISTIAN.
01:49:47 >> DOES THAT MEAN THERE WERE NOT CHRISTIANS OR WERE NOT
01:49:51 SAVED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT
01:49:52 REJECTED JESUS CHRIST? >> IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT
01:49:55 MEANS THAT ALL MEN ARE REALLY PATHETIC.
01:49:59 I MEAN REALLY AND YOU'RE ONLY SAVED BY GRACE.
01:50:02 YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY YOU'RE IF YOU'RE NOT SAVED BY GRACE THEN
01:50:06 EVERYONE'S GOING TO. >> OH, RIGHT.
01:50:09 >> NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE LET HIM KNOW THAT YES, WE'LL COME
01:50:13 COLLECT THAT FROM YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON.
01:50:24 BOUGHT A SUPERVISORS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER
01:50:29 KLEIN. I ALSO GO BY SERGEANT KLEIN OF
01:50:31 THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS. AND WHEN I FIRST GOT OUT OF THE
01:50:35 MARINE CORPS I WENT TO NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY
01:50:37 AND IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED
01:50:38 STATES. THEY ALSO DO RESEARCH.
01:50:40 SO EVERYTHING THAT I'M SHARING WITH YOU IS THROUGH RESEARCH ON
01:50:42 INVESTIGATE OF SKILLS A BACHELOR OF SCIENCE OF
01:50:46 INVESTIGATION AND WE ARE IN A VERY TROUBLING TIME A 100 YEAR
01:50:49 WAR BASICALLY AND IT'S BASICALLY EVERY UNIVERSITY
01:50:53 IN SAN FRANCISCO PUT PEOPLE ON RESEARCH AND IT'S UNETHICAL.
01:50:57 WE HAVE THE PROOF WE GAVE IT TO THE SHERIFF.
01:51:01 PLEASE USE YOUR VOICE TO GET THE SHERIFF TO MOVE ON.
01:51:04 THREE PEOPLE THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE
01:51:07 MATT HANEY, RAM COPPOCK AND MATTHEW JOHNS.
01:51:12 THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE CULPABLE AND ARE AWARE OF THIS
01:51:15 . HOWEVER, THOSE THREE PEOPLE ARE
01:51:16 THE MOST CULPABLE AND WE'RE ASKING THE SHERIFF TO MOVE FOR
01:51:19 AN ARRESTING MATT HANEY. AND WE KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT
01:51:23 BECAUSE HE HAS A FRIENDSHIP WITH THEM.
01:51:25 BUT AGAIN, THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HERE DO YOU HAVE
01:51:27 THAT REPORT IF YOU NEED ANOTHER COPY OF THAT REPORT, I CAN
01:51:31 FORWARD IT TO YOU. BUT WE NEED EVERYONE IN THIS
01:51:32 ROOM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BELMONT REPORT IS AND THIS WAS
01:51:35 CREATED BECAUSE OF SAN FRANCISCO IN 1978.
01:51:38 THIS REPORT WAS ON THE BELMONT REPORT.
01:51:39 I WAS CREATED IN 1979. I HAD TO GO BACK IN THE MARINE
01:51:43 CORPS FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY BECAUSE I WAS EDUCATING PEOPLE
01:51:50 ABOUT THIS. THAT'S HOW SERIOUS IT IS.
01:51:51 PEOPLE ARE DYING ON YOUR STREETS AND THAT'S WHY THE
01:51:54 MILITARY WAS GOING TO BE CALLED IN AND JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR,
01:51:58 THE MARINE CORPS, THE ARMY, THE NAVY AND THE AIR FORCE CAN COME
01:52:01 IN AT ANY TIME WHEN THERE ARE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
01:52:03 HAPPENING ON YOUR WATCH. SO PLEASE GET WITH THE SHERIFF.
01:52:06 PLEASE MOVE ON THIS RIGHT AWAY. AND AGAIN IT'S MATT HANEY, RON
01:52:10 CO-PACKER AND MATTHEW JOHNS. AND IF IT'S NOT DONE SOONER WE
01:52:13 WILL ADD PEOPLE TO THE LIST. THANK YOU.
01:52:17 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THANK SPEAKER BOARD PRESIDENT
01:52:26 MANAGEMENT AND BOARD MEMBERS. MY NAME IS RICHARD SD PETERSON
01:52:34 . >> I'M STILL VERY DISTURBED
01:52:38 ABOUT THE APPARENT USE OF THE MAYOR OF A PERSONAL COMPUTER
01:52:42 THAT IS NOW GOING TO BECOME THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT COMPUTER OF
01:52:49 SAN FRANCISCO. I THINK THAT THIS IS DANGEROUS
01:52:50 BECAUSE HE CAN THEN MANIPULATE WHAT IS BEING RELEASED TO THE
01:52:57 PUBLIC AND FOR EXAMPLE, I'M DRESSED LIKE THIS BECAUSE NEXT
01:53:04 SUMMER IS 60 YEARS FOR THE SUMMER OF LOVE.
01:53:09 THAT WAS IN 1967. >> I CAME TO SAN FRANCISCO
01:53:14 IN 64 AS AN ADULT AND HAVE LIVED HERE EVER SINCE, HAVE
01:53:18 MADE MY PROFESSION HERE AND IN FEDERAL COURTS AND I HAVE NEVER
01:53:22 QUITE SEEN THE EXCEPT FOR MAYBE OUR PRESIDENT TO GRAB A POWER
01:53:29 THAT THE MAYOR IS NOW GRABBING A AND I HEAR THAT THE WEST SIDE
01:53:37 IS UP IN ALARM AND WELL THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE THE
01:53:41 MAYOR WANTS TO PUT THROUGH A TAX POLICY THAT FAVORS THE
01:53:44 DOWNTOWN INSTEAD OF THE PEOPLE OUT IN THE WEST SIDE DISTRICT
01:53:49 AND DISTRICT FOUR AND FIVE. I BELIEVE IT IS AND THE
01:53:58 COMPUTER WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THINGS LIKE HOW MANY
01:54:02 PARCELS ARE OUT THERE. WELL WE CAN GET THAT RIGHT NOW
01:54:05 BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE CHILDREN IN THE WEST SIDE
01:54:09 VERSUS DOWNTOWN AREAS? AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
01:54:13 BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE, MAYBE IN DISTRICT EIGHT WE OUGHT TO
01:54:18 LOOK TO ART TO BE LOOKING NEXT ELECTION FOR A STRAIGHT
01:54:21 IN DISTRICT EIGHT AND MAYBE CHILDREN SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED
01:54:29 IN POPULATIONS. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
01:54:32 >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER GOOD AFTERNOON BOARD GRIFFIN
01:54:40 LEE HERE AT DISTRICT TO RESIDENT AND STAFF I CONNECT
01:54:44 THEIR STAFF HERE FOR A COUPLE DIFFERENT REASONS.
01:54:48 ONE I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE BOARD BASED OFF OF MEMBER
01:54:52 FEEDBACK TO LOOK INTO CHANGING SOME OF THE DESIGN AND PROPOSE
01:54:59 PLANS FOR THE INNER SUNSET TRANSPORTATION STUDY THAT IS
01:55:03 PART OF DISTRICT SEVEN SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE A LOT OF
01:55:07 MEMBERS CONCERNED ABOUT THE BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE BEING
01:55:11 PROPOSED ON SEVENTH AVENUE AND AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION
01:55:15 OUR MEMBERS HAVE SUGGESTED POTENTIALLY CONSIDERING A BIKE
01:55:19 PROTECTED LANE ON EITHER FIFTH, SIXTH OR NINTH AVENUE.
01:55:24 >> THE REASON FOR THAT SPECIFICALLY IS BECAUSE WHEN
01:55:27 YOU'RE GOING WEST ON LINCOLN WAY TURNING ON SEVENTH IT'S ONE
01:55:33 OF THE ONLY OPTIONS TO TURN LEFT WITH A DESIGNATED LEFT
01:55:37 ARROW. FURTHERMORE, SEVENTH FIVE IS A
01:55:38 MAJOR THOROUGHFARE THERE FOR COMMUTERS COMING FROM THE EAST
01:55:43 SIDE. >> GETTING BACK TO THE GREEN
01:55:46 HONDA FOR US ETC. SECONDLY, I WOULD LIKE TO URGE THE BOARD TO
01:55:54 LOOK INTO POTENTIAL RELIEF OR SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT SMALL
01:55:58 BUSINESSES ALONG THE GEARY CORRIDOR WHERE THE SEWAGE
01:56:02 PROJECT IS TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW.
01:56:06 I THINK IT'S A TWO YEAR PROJECT AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE
01:56:09 HURTING IN THAT AREA RIGHT NOW AT THIS IS DIRECT FEEDBACK I'VE
01:56:13 HAD FROM CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST WEEK LASTLY NOT ON BEHALF
01:56:17 OF NECESSARILY CONNECTED THAT BUT I URGE THE BOARD TO
01:56:21 CONSIDER SOLUTIONS ALTHOUGH I DO AND WE DO SUPPORT RECOVERY
01:56:25 FIRST AND ABSTINENCE BASED SOLUTIONS I STILL THINK THE
01:56:29 CITY OWNS LOG CABIN RANCH AND I KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A LONGER
01:56:33 TERM PLAY BUT IT COULD BE A SOLUTION TO GET THOSE THAT NEED
01:56:37 SERVICES AND SHELTER IN AN ISOLATED AREA TO GET THEM BACK
01:56:41 ON TRACK. >> LASTLY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
01:56:44 COMMENTS I THINK SPEAKER WELCOME BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
01:56:55 AND MAYOR OFFERS A SAN FRANCISCO THE TITLE OF MY
01:56:59 SPEECH TODAY IS ARE YOU A WOLF OR A SHEEP?
01:57:02 >> WHEN I WAS THREE I BROKE MY ARM.
01:57:04 I SET MY MOM INTO A FRENZY OF CHAOS AND A TOPSY TURVY ROAD TO
01:57:07 MOTHERHOOD. I WAS ONLY THREE YEARS OLD BACK
01:57:11 THEN. MY MOM SAID WE WERE GOING TO A
01:57:12 HOUSEBOAT FOR DINNER OF ECSTASY.
01:57:15 I CLIMBED THE LADDER OF A FACE FOR FORWARD MY BACK TOWARD THE
01:57:18 STEPS OF TEARS OF TWO HANDS HOLDING THE LADDER.
01:57:21 I WAS STUCK IN A THIRD STEP UNABLE TO GET OUT PREDICAMENT I
01:57:24 JUMP AND SCREAM AND LUCKILY THEY HIT THE FLOOR.
01:57:27 MY MOM HAD TO CANCEL ALL HER PLANS.
01:57:28 SHE CALLED A BEST DOCTOR TO LOCK TWO ARMED WITH SPLINTERS.
01:57:35 TO THIS DAY MY ARM WAS CROOKED. WORSE IT CAUSED SO MUCH AGONY
01:57:38 FOR MINE FOR YEARS TO COME. MY MOM ALWAYS GAVE ME THE WORLD
01:57:42 TO ME WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL AT AGE THREE SHE HIRED
01:57:44 SOMEONE TO STAND IN FRONT OF A SCHOOLYARD SO I WON'T CRY.
01:57:47 THE IMAGE OF HER HIDING A PERSON OUT TO WATCH ME OVER
01:57:50 ETCHED INTO MY HEAD. ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS
01:57:54 RESPECTED TEACHERS IT WAS MY MOM WHO GAVE THE WORLD
01:57:58 KINDNESS, COMPASSION AND POWERFUL IMAGE AS MY MOM.
01:58:02 MY MOM PASSED AWAY IN MARCH OF 2021 I CONFRONTED MAGGIE WONG
01:58:05 TO SEE MY MOM BEFORE SHE TOOK HER LAST BREATH.
01:58:09 MAGGIE WONG MS. CHINATOWN OF 2018 ALSO MISSED POPULARITY OF
01:58:13 MS.. CHINESE INTERNATIONAL 2019 FOR
01:58:19 MAGGIE SHE DID ALL SHE HAD DONE GAINING HER CROWN AND SEE MY
01:58:23 MOM GO WAS AS GOOD AS IT GETS BUT NOT FOR ME IN 2022.
01:58:28 BUT LISTEN TO JOE ROGAN DUDE I GOT ONE INVITE TO MY PODCAST
01:58:33 AND WITH THAT I DECIDED TO CREATE A WORLDWIDE CONSTITUTION
01:58:37 FOR JOE BIDEN. THE LIST OF FOUR AXIS OF FEMALE
01:58:41 SUPERPOWER HAS GROWN TO 28 SINCE THEN.
01:58:43 I IS ALL IN A DAY'S WORK. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
01:58:47 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> MY NAME IS W R DUFFY
01:58:57 TENDERLOIN NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVIST TODAY IS KIND OF THE
01:58:58 HIGH HOLY DAY FOR NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVISTS.
01:59:02 THE ELECTION DAY WHENEVER THEY FALL I WE WORK DILIGENTLY TO
01:59:08 SUPPORT ONE SIDE OR ANOTHER OF VARIOUS THINGS AND IT'S A
01:59:13 WONDERFUL THING THAT WHATEVER THE VOTERS VOTE FOR THAT'S WHAT
01:59:14 WE GO FOR. >> THAT'S WHERE WE GO WITH I
01:59:19 WOULD SAY THAT I FALL A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE MISHEAR
01:59:22 PASCAL'S BELIEFS THAN I DO TO THE CHRISTIAN GUY.
01:59:24 >> WELL, WE CERTAINLY GOT A WIDE RANGE OF BELIEFS HERE
01:59:28 TODAY AT THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND ONE THING I GUESS IT'S NOT
01:59:31 TOO UNSURPRISING THAT EVERYONE THEY'VE TALKED AGREED WITH IS
01:59:35 THAT WE'RE IN A BIT OF TROUBLE. WE'RE IN A DARK SPOT NOW I'D
01:59:38 LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT POLITICAL SWINGS OVER U.S.
01:59:43 HISTORY THEY'VE TEND TO BE IN THIS 60 TO 75 YEAR RANGE
01:59:48 LIKE FOR INSTANCE, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS
01:59:53 THE ONLY DOMINANT PARTY FOR ABOUT THAT LENGTH OF TIME
01:59:56 BEFORE THE REPUBLICANS CAME IN AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN
02:00:00 WERE THE DOMINANT PARTY FROM 1930 TO ABOUT 1990 ABOUT 60
02:00:03 YEARS. SO SINCE REAGAN AND THE
02:00:06 CONGRESS STARTED TO TURN REPUBLICAN, THAT WAS, YOU KNOW,
02:00:11 AROUND 1990 THAT WAS ABOUT 40 YEARS AGO, 30, 35 YEARS AGO.
02:00:16 >> SO IF HOWEVER TODAY TURNS OUT IF THIS IS THE BOTTOM IF
02:00:23 THIS IS THE BOTTOM AND WE CAN START MOVING TO A BETTER PLACE,
02:00:27 THEN WE HAVE WE'LL HAVE DODGED A CALAMITY WORSE THAN JIM CROW,
02:00:34 VIETNAM, THE COVID SHUTDOWN, THE 28 RECESSION, HURRICANE
02:00:37 KATRINA, THE AIDS CRISIS AND JONESTOWN COMBINED AND I
02:00:41 COULD THROW IN MILK AND MOSCONI AND PROP 13 AND MANY OTHER
02:00:42 THINGS IF THIS IS THE BOTTOM WE WILL BE VERY LUCKY I BESEECH
02:00:49 PROVIDENCE THAT THAT BE THE CASE.
02:00:50 >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS .
