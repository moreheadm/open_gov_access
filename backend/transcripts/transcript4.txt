00:21:25 TODAY'S MEETING IN MEMORY OF STEVE KELLERMAN WHO DIED ON
00:21:31 APRIL 27TH AT THE AGE OF 83. STEVE WAS BORN IN 1941 AND GREW
00:21:34 UP IN PHILADELPHIA. HIS FAMILY WAS TIGHT KNIT.
00:21:35 HIS MOTHER WAS BORN INTO AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY LIVING ON THE
00:21:38 LOWER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN. AFTER LIVING FOR A TIME IN NEW
00:21:42 YORK, THE SIBLINGS SETTLED AROUND PHILADELPHIA
00:21:45 AND REMAINED CLOSE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
00:21:46 STEVE'S MOTHER PASSED ON TO HIM A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND CARE
00:21:50 FOR OTHERS THAT STAYED WITH HIM THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE.
00:21:53 AFTER GRADUATING FROM TEMPLE UNIVERSITY IN 1964, STEVE MOVED
00:21:57 TO SAN FRANCISCO TO JOIN THE AIR FORCE RESERVES AND EARNED
00:22:00 HIS MASTER'S DEGREE IN INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY AT SAN
00:22:02 FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY. AFTER RECEIVING HIS MASTER'S,
00:22:04 STEVE JOINED THE FEDERATED DEPARTMENT STORES INC THE
00:22:08 PARENT COMPANY OF MACY'S IN THEIR H.R.
00:22:09 DEPARTMENT. WHILE WORKING AT FEDERATED HE
00:22:12 MET HIS FUTURE WIFE SUSAN WALKING DOWN UNION STREET ONE
00:22:16 DAY IN 1970. STEVE ASKED STUART SUSAN WHO
00:22:19 WAS CARRYING A VACUUM SHE HAD BORROWED FROM A FRIEND IF HE
00:22:21 COULD BORROW IT WHEN SHE WAS DONE.
00:22:23 SUSAN, WHO DIED IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR AND STEVE MARRIED A
00:22:24 YEAR LATER AND REMAINED TOGETHER FOR THE REST OF THEIR
00:22:27 LIVES. >> STEVE WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME
00:22:30 IN THE LATE 1970S DURING THE OIL EMBARGO.
00:22:31 A PICTURE OF STEVE RIDING HIS BIKE ON HIS MORNING COMMUTE
00:22:34 DOWNTOWN MADE THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE.
00:22:37 AROUND THE SAME TIME HE FOUNDED HIS OWN CONSULTING FIRM
00:22:41 KELLERMANN AND ASSOCIATES. KELLERMANN ASSOCIATES
00:22:42 SPECIALIZED IN PUTTING TOGETHER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HIRING PLANS
00:22:46 FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF HIS LIFE.
00:22:50 STEVE TRIED TO BETTER HIS COMMUNITY IN THE 1970S.
00:22:52 HE ORGANIZED HIS NEIGHBORS TO GET THE FIRST SPEED BUMPS ADDED
00:22:55 ON CUMBERLAND STREET NEAR DELORES PARK.
00:22:58 AFTER MOVING TO NO VALLEY, HE HELPED UNDERGROUND THE
00:22:59 ELECTRICAL WIRES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ALTHOUGH HE FAILED
00:23:02 TO ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL FOR HIS OWN STREET.
00:23:04 >> THROUGHOUT HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE
00:23:07 BIG BROTHERS PROGRAM AS HIS OWN AS HIS OWN SON ZACH STARTED
00:23:11 SCHOOL. STEVE JOINED THE BOARD OF
00:23:11 TRUSTEES AT THE BRANDEIS LITTLE OLD SCHOOL ON BROTHERHOOD WAY.
00:23:15 TODAY THE BRANDEIS SCHOOL IN HIS EARLY 60S, STEVE
00:23:18 TRANSFORMED HIS FAVORITE WAY TO COMMUTE AND EXERCISE HIS BIKE
00:23:21 INTO A WAY TO DO GOOD. HE SERVED AS A COACH FOR TEAM
00:23:25 AND TRAINING, WRITING THOUSANDS OF MILES AND RAISING HUNDREDS
00:23:27 OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR LYMPHOMA RESEARCH.
00:23:30 HE CONTINUED TO CYCLE INTO HIS 70S.
00:23:32 >> AT 75 HE RODE AROUND LAKE TAHOE.
00:23:36 >> STEVE STEVE'S LIFE FROM HIS CAREER TO HIS FREE TIME
00:23:37 REVOLVED AROUND HIS LOVE FOR PEOPLE.
00:23:40 HE WAS A SOCIAL GUY WITH A BIG PERSONALITY AND HE LOVED TO
00:23:44 DANCE. OVER THE LAST DECADE STEVE
00:23:45 STRUGGLED WITH DEMENTIA. HE MOVED INTO THE MEMORY CARE
00:23:48 FACILITY IN THE FRANK RESIDENCE AT THE JEWISH HOME FOR THE LAST
00:23:51 FOUR YEARS OF HIS LIFE. NEVERTHELESS, HE REMAINED THE
00:23:53 LIFE OF THE PARTY FOR HIS GRANDDAUGHTER'S BAT MITZVAH.
00:23:56 HE CAME IN A WHEELCHAIR BUT REFUSING TO BE SIDELINED HE HIT
00:23:59 THE DANCE FLOOR ONCE AGAIN. STEVE SURVIVED BY HIS SON ZACH,
00:24:03 HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ANDREA AND HIS TWO GRANDCHILDREN
00:24:05 SHOSHANA AND JACOB. >> ASKED TO DESCRIBE HIS DAD'S
00:24:09 ,ZACH SAID HE WAS A FORCE HE NEVER FADED INTO THE CROWD.
00:24:10 HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE FRONT. HE WAS ALWAYS THERE.
00:24:13 STEVE KELLERMAN, YOU WILL BE MISSED.
00:24:17 REST IN PEACE AND MAY YOUR MEMORY BE A BLESSING AND THE
00:24:18 REST I SUBMIT. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
00:24:21 WE HAVE TWO MINUTES LEFT. SUPERVISOR MELGAR.
00:24:25 >> THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M
00:24:29 INTRODUCING ALONG WITH SUPERVISOR CHERYL AND STARTER
00:24:32 LEGISLATION TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FILL VACANT SPACES AND TO
00:24:36 PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR NEW BUSINESSES TRYING TO EXPAND
00:24:40 . THIS LEGISLATION WOULD DO TWO
00:24:41 THINGS ONE ELIMINATE CAPS ON STOREFRONT SIZES IN CERTAIN
00:24:44 NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT AND INSTEAD REQUIRE A
00:24:48 CONDITIONAL USE AUTHORIZATION. THIS WOULD ALLOW NEIGHBORHOOD
00:24:52 FEEDBACK ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS.
00:24:55 IN THE PAST WE HAD TO PASS A LEGISLATION SPECIFIC TO A
00:24:59 BUSINESS OR SITE WHICH IS NOT REALLY GREAT POLICY.
00:25:02 >> AND THE SECOND THING WE WOULD DO IS REMOVE THE
00:25:04 CONDITIONAL USE REQUIREMENT FOR SPACES THAT SUBDIVIDE IF THEY
00:25:10 ARE GETTING CLOSER TO CONFORMITY WITH A CODE.
00:25:13 THIS ALEMAO THIS WILL ALLOW SMALLER BUSINESSES TO FILL
00:25:15 LARGER SPACES AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE ALL WANT.
00:25:19 >> WE ARE FACING DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CHALLENGES TODAY WITH
00:25:26 EVOLVING BUSINESS MODELS AND VACANCIES THAT ARE
00:25:29 DIFFICULT TO FILL IN OUR CURRENT MARKET ESPECIALLY
00:25:33 LARGER SPACES LIKE THE MANY WALGREENS THAT HAVE BECOME
00:25:37 EMPTY. THIS IS ONE PART OF A
00:25:38 LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE I HOPE WILL ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE
00:25:42 CHALLENGES IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY. I WANT TO EXTEND MY THANKS TO
00:25:46 HEATHER GOODMAN AND JULIA WALKER NELSON AT THE CITY
00:25:49 ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND ESPECIALLY TO AUDREY MALONE
00:25:53 AT THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR SUPPORT ON THIS DRAFTING
00:25:57 THIS LEGISLATION. >> I ALSO WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT
00:26:01 YOU MAY REMEMBER COLLEAGUES THAT LAST YEAR WE HELD A
00:26:05 HEARING THAT PROMPTED AN AUDIT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOOLOGICAL
00:26:09 SOCIETY. AT THAT AUDIT HAS NOT GONE WELL
00:26:17 AND I HAVE REQUESTED TO BUDGET CHAIR CHAN TO CONSIDER A MOTION
00:26:21 AT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO HOLD THE FUNDING FOR THE ZOO
00:26:25 IN RESERVE TO INCENTIVIZE COOPERATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH
00:26:29 THE AUDIT. I AM GRATEFUL THAT SHE WOULD
00:26:33 ENTERTAIN THE REQUEST AND WE WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO
00:26:37 SUPPORT THIS ORGANIZATION AS THEY BECOME SUCCESSFUL,
00:26:40 TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE. AND THE REST I SUBMIT.
00:26:45 THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
00:26:48 >> THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. LET'S GO TO OUR 230 SPECIAL
00:26:52 ORDER. THE SPECIAL ORDER AT 230 IS THE
00:26:55 RECOGNITION OF COMMENDATIONS FOR MERITORIOUS SERVICE TO THE
00:26:59 CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
00:27:00 >> ALL RIGHT, COLLEAGUES NOW NORMALLY I HAVE MYSELF GO LARGE
00:27:10 FIRST. BUT TODAY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT
00:27:11 THAT MY HONOREE IS OUR POLICE CHIEF, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO
00:27:14 I'M GOING TO TAKE A PRIVILEGE AND PUT MYSELF FIRST WITH
00:27:18 APOLOGIES. >> IF THERE ARE NO OBJECTIONS.
00:27:23 CHIEF SCOTT, PLEASE COME FORWARD.
00:27:38 >> I SAID SOME OF THESE NICE THINGS ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF
00:27:42 AGO IN THE MAYOR'S CEREMONIAL ROOM.
00:27:46 I WILL BE HONEST THIS IS A BITTERSWEET COMMENDATION FOR
00:27:50 ME. >> I'M NOT HAPPY.
00:27:53 THIS IS I WILL NOTE CERTAINLY NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS BOARD
00:27:57 HAS HONORED CHIEF SCOTT. ANY NUMBER OF US HAVE
00:28:01 RECOGNIZED HIM OVER THE YEARS FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE
00:28:05 TO THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THAT HAS BEEN
00:28:06 WELL-DESERVED. BUT THIS IS SADLY OUR FINAL
00:28:10 OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE AND THANK HIM WHILE HE'S STILL
00:28:14 CHIEF OF OUR SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT.
00:28:17 AFTER EIGHT YEARS LEADING THAT DEPARTMENT CHIEF SCOTT'S FINAL
00:28:18 DAY WILL BE JUNE 22ND. >> NINE YEARS AGO IN THE WAKE
00:28:24 OF MULTIPLE OFFICER INVOLVED FACE THAT FATALITIES A RACIST
00:28:25 TEXT MESSAGE SCANDAL INCREASINGLY FRAUGHT TO PUT IT
00:28:32 MILDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN CITY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THE POPE
00:28:36 . AND AMID INCREASING COMMUNITY
00:28:36 FRUSTRATION WITH THE PACE OF REFORM, THE POLICE COMMISSION
00:28:41 BEGAN ITS SEARCH FOR SAN FRANCISCO'S NEXT POLICE CHIEF.
00:28:45 >> DURING THAT SEARCH, THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF
00:28:46 JUSTICE'S OFFICE OF COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES
00:28:49 RELEASED THE RESULTS OF A SIX MONTH LONG INVESTIGATION INTO
00:28:53 THE S.F. PD. AN INVESTIGATION INITIATED AT
00:28:56 MAYOR LEE'S REQUEST. >> THE REPORT FOUND THE
00:28:59 DEPARTMENT DEFICIENT IN EVERY OPERATIONAL AREA ASSESSED
00:29:03 AND INCLUDED 272 RECOMMENDED CHANGES.
00:29:06 THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CALLED FOR THE REPORT TO BE A
00:29:07 GUIDING LIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO'S HIRING PROCESS,
00:29:10 SUGGESTING THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD REQUIRE
00:29:14 DEDICATED AND FOCUSED LEADERSHIP.
00:29:14 JANUARY OF 2017 MERELY SWORE IN BILL SCOTT AS THE CHIEF OF
00:29:22 THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT.
00:29:23 HE WAS AT THE TIME A 27 YEAR VETERAN OF THE LOS ANGELES
00:29:26 POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO'D RISEN FROM A PATROL OFFICER TO DEPUTY
00:29:29 CHIEF OF THE LAPD'S SOUTH BUREAU.
00:29:32 HAVING GROWN UP IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING
00:29:36 THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, SCOTT WAS KNOWN IN SOUTH L.A.
00:29:39 FOR HIS ABILITY TO EMPATHIZE WITH RESIDENTS AND HIS
00:29:40 COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE POLICE.
00:29:44 >> IN SAN FRANCISCO HIS COMMITMENT TO REFORM WAS
00:29:48 IMMEDIATELY TESTED WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE UNDER THE
00:29:51 FIRST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DECIDED IT WAS NO LONGER
00:29:53 WILLING TO OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS OWN
00:29:56 RECOMMENDATIONS. HE SOUGHT INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT
00:29:57 FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
00:30:00 IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. CALIFORNIA DOJ FOUND THE SFPD
00:30:04 COMPLIANT WITH 97% OF THE 272 RECOMMENDATIONS.
00:30:07 CHIEF SCOTT HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE MONUMENTAL MISSION FOR
00:30:11 WHICH HE WAS HIRED. >> THAT RECORD OF REFORM ALONE
00:30:14 WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROUD LEGACY FOR ANY POLICE CHIEF.
00:30:18 HOWEVER, THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC. GEORGE FLOYD'S SUMMER A
00:30:24 NATIONWIDE CRIME SURGE POST-PANDEMIC AND THE
00:30:25 PROLIFERATION OF ENCAMPMENTS AND DRUG SCENES IN PUBLIC
00:30:29 SPACES IN NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS SAN FRANCISCO EACH PRESENTED
00:30:32 WHAT AT OTHER TIMES WOULD HAVE BEEN A GENERATIONAL CHALLENGE
00:30:36 FOR A METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT.
00:30:37 CHIEF SCOTT NEVER LOST HIS COOL AND ROSE TO MEET EVERY
00:30:41 CHALLENGE PRESENTED. AND IN A CITY THAT IS
00:30:45 NOTORIOUSLY TOUGH ON COPS, CHIEF SCOTT MAINTAINED THE
00:30:49 TRUST OF COMMUNITY AND THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS.
00:30:52 AS THE LONGEST SERVING POLICE CHIEF SINCE 1970, HE'S WORKED
00:30:56 WITH FOUR MAYORS FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS, SCORES OF POLICE
00:31:00 COMMISSION COMMISSIONERS AND MEMBERS OF THIS BOARD OF
00:31:03 SUPERVISORS. SAN FRANCISCANS ARE A FRACTIOUS
00:31:07 BUNCH AND THEIR ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS REFLECT
00:31:08 A DIVERSITY OF PASSIONATELY HELD PERSPECTIVES.
00:31:11 AND YET I'VE BEEN STRUCK THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE ON
00:31:15 SO MANY SOCIAL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY QUESTIONS AGREE
00:31:19 ON THE EXCELLENCE, HONESTY, INTEGRITY AND FUNDAMENTAL
00:31:23 DECENCY OF BILL SCOTT. >> TODAY WE ARE LIVING IN A
00:31:27 SAFER CITY BECAUSE OF CHIEF SCOTT.
00:31:30 >> FROM 2017 TO 2024 CRIME ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES DROPPED
00:31:34 42%. THIS YEAR CRIME CONTINUES TO
00:31:38 FALL AT DOUBLE DIGIT RATES FROM THIS TIME LAST YEAR INCLUDING A
00:31:41 43% DROP IN MOTOR VEHICLE THEFTS.
00:31:42 HOMICIDES IN OUR CITY ARE THE LOWEST THEY'VE BEEN IN SIX
00:31:45 DECADES. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE NATIONAL
00:31:48 TREND. CRIME IS DROPPING HERE FASTER
00:31:49 THAN IT IS IN OUR PEER CITIES. CHIEF SCOTT CAME TO THIS CITY
00:31:52 AS AN OUTSIDER AND AGAINST ALL ODDS HE WON THE RESPECT OF THE
00:31:56 CITY'S LEADERSHIP AND OUR MANY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES.
00:32:00 HE'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL ON EVERY METRICS CITY HALL COULD HAVE
00:32:04 SET FOR HIM. HE'S PROVEN THAT REFORM
00:32:05 AND SAFETY NEED NOT BE OPPOSITIONAL TO EACH OTHER.
00:32:09 DONE RIGHT. THEY ARE IN FACT COMPLIMENTARY
00:32:12 . CHIEF SCOTT, YOU'VE TRANSFORMED
00:32:13 OUR DEPARTMENT. YOU'VE LET IT THROUGH AN
00:32:15 UNPRECEDENTEDLY CHALLENGING PERIOD FOR POLICING NATIONALLY
00:32:16 AND LOCALLY. >> WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR
00:32:20 SERVICE TO SAN FRANCISCO. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO HONOR
00:32:23 YOU AGAIN HERE ONE LAST TIME FOR A JOB EXCEEDINGLY WELL DONE
00:32:30 . AND BEFORE YOU SPEAK MY
00:32:30 COLLEAGUES WANT TO TALK TO. >> SO SUPERVISOR DORSEY.
00:32:34 THANK YOU PRESIDENT MANDOLIN CHIEF.
00:32:37 >> I AGREE WITH THE BOARD PRESIDENT THAT THIS IS REALLY A
00:32:42 BITTERSWEET MOMENT. I JUST WANT TO SAY PERSONALLY
00:32:45 THAT I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL THAT YOU GAVE ME A CHANCE
00:32:51 AND THEN I'M ALSO GRATEFUL THAT YOU GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE.
00:32:54 >> I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. AND DURING THIS INCREDIBLY
00:32:59 DIFFICULT TIME FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, MAYBE ONE OF THE
00:33:02 MOST DIFFICULT TIMES IN AT LEAST RECENT HISTORY A ONCE
00:33:06 IN A CENTURY PANDEMIC AND THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD.
00:33:09 I JUST WATCHED YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN RISE TO THE MOMENT
00:33:13 WITH EQUANIMITY AND GRACE AND I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM YOU
00:33:17 AND I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO
00:33:20 WORK WITH YOU FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.
00:33:21 THANK YOU. >> SUPERVISOR WALTON THANK YOU,
00:33:25 PRESIDENT MEADOW. AND I KNOW WE HONORED YOU
00:33:27 IN THIS CHAMBER A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND THAT OF COURSE
00:33:31 WAS PRIOR TO KNOWING THAT YOU WERE RETIRING AND LEAVING US
00:33:35 HERE IN THIS CITY. >> BUT I DO JUST AGAIN WANT TO
00:33:38 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO SAN FRANCISCO FOR YOUR WORK
00:33:42 ON REFORM AND FOR COMING INTO A CITY AND REALLY WORKING HARD TO
00:33:49 MAKE CHANGE WHILE KEEPING THE CITY SAFE WHICH I KNOW IS
00:33:53 DEFINITELY A TASK. >> I DON'T AGREE WITH
00:33:57 SUPERVISOR OR PRESIDENT MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT THAT
00:33:58 SAN FRANCISCO IS NOTORIOUSLY TOUGH ON COPS.
00:34:01 >> I WOULD ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT I WILL SAY THIS
00:34:05 IS MOST DEFINITELY A CHALLENGING CITY TO LEAD IN AND
00:34:12 YOU HAVE DONE IT WITH GRACE. AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU
00:34:14 AND APPRECIATE YOU AND JUST SAY I WISH YOU THE BEST IN ALL OF
00:34:17 YOUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS. >> THANK YOU.
00:34:20 >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MELGAR.

00:34:35 IT ALL DONE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT AN
00:34:36 OUTSTANDING HUMAN BEING YOU ARE.
00:34:39 I THINK, YOU KNOW, PART OF WHAT MAKES US SUCCESSFUL
00:34:43 IN LEADERSHIP IS YOU KNOW THAT THE THINGS THAT WE DO FOR SURE
00:34:49 . BUT I THINK SOMETHING THAT
00:34:50 PEOPLE DON'T APPRECIATE AS MUCH AND SHOULD IS THAT TO BE A
00:34:57 LEADER OF THE STATUTE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN YOU NEED TO HAVE
00:35:01 OUTSTANDING HUMAN QUALITIES AND YOU REALLY DO.

00:35:24 CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU HAVE HAD ABOUT DIFFICULT SUBJECTS WITH
00:35:31 YOUR COMMAND STAFF, WITH PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES WHICH REALLY
00:35:35 IMPRESSED ME IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF A HUMAN BEING THAT
00:35:39 YOU ARE. I AM SO PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL
00:35:40 THAT YOU WERE WITH US AT THIS MOMENT.

00:40:45 AND YOU REALLY VALUE BEING WITH THE COMMUNITY WALKING ALONGSIDE
00:40:49 FOLKS ON THE GROUND AND I THINK THAT IS REALLY CLEAR AND THE
00:40:52 LATINO COMMUNITY THAT YOU HAVE MADE INROADS WITH OVER THE
00:40:56 SEVERAL YEARS AND SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT
00:40:59 AND WISH YOU BEST OF LUCK. >> THANK YOU.
00:41:00 SUPERVISOR FIELD SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD CHIEF SCOTT, I JUST
00:41:03 WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP OVER THE LAST
00:41:08 SEVERAL YEARS BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR LEADING WITH BOTH
00:41:11 INNOVATION AND COLLABORATION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TWO
00:41:14 GO HAND IN HAND AT THE MAYOR'S HONORING OF YOU YOU COMMENTED
00:41:18 HOW THERE IS DEPARTMENT HEADS COMING TO HONOR THE CHIEF THAT
00:41:22 SPEAKS TO YOU RECOGNIZING THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO WORK TOGETHER
00:41:25 AND I THINK THERE'S NO BETTER REPRESENTATION OF THAT.
00:41:27 WHEN YOU INITIATED THE DMCC DRUG MARKET AGENCY COORDINATION
00:41:30 CENTER WHICH WAS REALLY AN INTERAGENCY EFFORT THAT AS A PD
00:41:33 LED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PUBLIC HEALTH THE DA'S OFFICE
00:41:37 SHERIFF'S OFFICE, PUBLIC WORKS AND I THINK THE TENDERLOIN HAS
00:41:42 BENEFITED SO MUCH FROM THE INITIATIVES AND THE FOUNDATIONS
00:41:47 THAT YOU LED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE REST OF THE CITY.
00:41:50 AND NOW AS WE'RE SEEING THE TENDERLOIN ON THE UPSWING, IT
00:41:54 IS REALLY DUE TO YOUR EFFORT AND YOUR LEADERSHIP THAT THAT
00:41:57 FOUNDATION HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE THAT WE CAN BENEFIT
00:41:59 FROM THE SUCCESS AND YOUR EFFORT IN SETTING UP THAT
00:42:02 FOUNDATION FOR AS YOU LEAVE. BUT ALSO I WANTED TO COMMEND
00:42:06 YOU ON THE CULTURE THAT YOU CREATED WITHIN THE POLICE
00:42:09 DEPARTMENT. I SEE IT EVERY DAY IN ALL THREE
00:42:12 STATIONS THAT ARE IN DISTRICT FIVE BUT SPECIFICALLY IN THE
00:42:13 TENDERLOIN AND WHERE I SEE BEAT OFFICERS AND OFFICERS ENGAGING
00:42:17 IN THE COMMUNITY AND RECOGNIZING THEIR
00:42:21 RESPONSIBILITY TO ENGAGE WITH A VARIETY OF COMMUNITIES
00:42:25 AND DEMOGRAPHICS AND THAT AGAIN I BELIEVE IS IS DUE TO YOUR
00:42:26 LEADERSHIP OF COLLABORATION WITHIN COMMUNITY BUT ALSO
00:42:30 ACROSS DEPARTMENTS. AND WE'RE SEEING THE RESULTS OF
00:42:33 THAT DUE TO YOUR LEADERSHIP. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL

00:43:20 NEED TO BE FILLED AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE BE YOUR
00:43:23 GREATEST LEGACY IS THAT THAT CULTURE OF LEADERSHIP AND THE
00:43:29 CULTURE OF OF CHANGING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF OF
00:43:34 TEAM MEMBERS THAT YOU WORKED WITH THROUGH THE YEARS.

01:24:51 HOW TO ACCOMMODATE NEW DEVELOPMENT IN A WAY THAT FITS
01:24:55 THE NEEDS, THE VULNERABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN EACH

01:27:23 URGING ABOUT THE STATE TO RECONSIDER RESCINDING COVERAGE
01:27:30 FOR MEDICAID FOR ACUPUNCTURE. KNOWING THAT IS A REALLY A A
01:27:37 PENNY WISE DOLLAR FOR DECISION BECAUSE ACUPUNCTURE CARE IS
01:27:41 TRULY A PREVENTIVE CARE. >> IT'S IT WILL PROVIDE PAIN
01:27:46 TREATMENT FOR MANY OTHER TYPES OF TREATMENTS THAT REALLY ALLOW
01:27:50 INDIVIDUALS TO RECEIVE PAIN RELIEF AND MANY OTHER
01:27:54 TREATMENTS WITHOUT GOING TO FULLY TO MEDICATION.
01:28:00 AND THIS TYPE OF CARE IS TRULY WHAT WE WANT TO SEE MORE OF
01:28:04 IN TERMS OF COVERAGE FOR ANY TYPE OF HEALTH CARE,
01:28:08 PARTICULARLY MEDICAID. EVEN TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
01:28:09 COSTS SAVING MEASURES. AND I TRULY HOPE THAT OUR STATE
01:28:16 AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REALLY BEGIN TO LOOK AT MEDICAID
01:28:19 AND COVERAGE IN IN HEALTH CARE IN A WAY THAT IS REALLY ABOUT
01:28:24 COST EFFECTIVENESS AND NOT JUST ABOUT COST CUTTING.
01:28:28 SO THAT IS WHAT I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS
01:28:32 RESOLUTION IS THE SECOND TIME THAT THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN
01:28:35 FRANCISCO SENDING THIS MESSAGE TO OUR STATE LEGISLATURE.
01:28:38 I TRULY HOPE THAT THEY WILL RECONSIDER.

01:28:58 SAN FRANCISCO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHO PASSED AWAY LAST
01:29:01 MONTH PEACEFULLY AT HER HOME SURROUNDED BY HER FAMILY AFTER
01:29:05 A COURAGEOUS BATTLE WITH CANCER.
01:29:07 SHE WAS 76. SHARON SERVED OUR CITY FOR 26
01:29:11 YEARS. WHAT BEGAN AS A SIX MONTH
01:29:12 TEMPORARY JOB WOULD IN FACT BECOME A REMARKABLE CAREER
01:29:15 BEGINNING IN THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OR COUNTY ACCOUNTING
01:29:18 TEAM. SHE LATER JOINED THE CHILDREN
01:29:19 AND FAMILY TEAM UNDER LAURIE GIORGI WHO WOULD GO ON TO SERVE
01:29:23 AS A SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE.
01:29:26 BUT IT WAS IN HER ROLE AS THE LONGTIME FRONT OFFICE
01:29:30 RECEPTIONIST RIGHT HERE ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF CITY HALL WHERE
01:29:31 MANY OF US HAD THE CHANCE TO MEET AND GET TO KNOW SHARON
01:29:36 AND TO APPRECIATE WHY HER WARMTH AND WELCOMING DEMEANOR
01:29:39 LEFT SUCH LASTING IMPRESSIONS ON THOSE BLESSED TO KNOW HER.
01:29:42 SHARON WAS MORE THAN THE FACE OF THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
01:29:46 SHE WAS ITS BEATING HEART AND SHE HANDLED EVERYTHING THAT
01:29:50 CAME HER WAY WITH PATIENTS GRACE AND STRENGTH.
01:29:51 SHE BROUGHT CALM TO DIFFICULT SITUATIONS WITH KINDNESS, POISE
01:29:54 AND WITH A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.
01:29:58 I SPENT 14 YEARS IN THAT OFFICE WORKING WITH COLLEAGUES WHO
01:30:01 WOULD GO ON TO BECOME STATE AND FEDERAL JUDGES STATE
01:30:05 SENATOR, A STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, GENERAL MANAGER OF A
01:30:06 PUBLIC UTILITY AND EVEN A VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
01:30:10 YET ON ANY LIST OF FORMER COLLEAGUES OF THAT OFFICE,
01:30:14 SHARON WOULD BE AT THE TOP OF IT.
01:30:16 EARLIER TODAY I WAS SPEAKING WITH FORMER CITY ATTORNEY
01:30:18 DENNIS HERRERA ABOUT SHARON AND HE REMINDED ME ABOUT HOW
01:30:22 FIERCELY PROTECTIVE SHE WAS OF ALL OF US WHO WORKED IN THE
01:30:25 FRONT OFFICES JUST DOWN THE HALL FROM THIS CHAMBER.
01:30:29 ESPECIALLY WHEN OPPOSING LITIGANTS OR LAWYERS WOULD SHOW
01:30:32 UP DEMANDING TO BE SEEN OR WHEN DEMONSTRATORS WOULD SHOW UP TO
01:30:36 TO PROTEST MARRIAGE EQUALITY OR ANY OF THE CONTENTIOUS CASES
01:30:40 OVER THE YEARS FOR WHICH THAT OFFICE WAS CELEBRE AIDED
01:30:44 AND SOMETIMES SCORNED IN NATIONAL NEWS MEDIA.
01:30:45 THEN I SPOKE ABOUT WHAT A STRONG AND LOYAL JOB SHE DID OF
01:30:49 GATEKEEPING OFTEN IN WAYS FEW OF US KNEW.
01:30:52 SHE WAS OUR MAMA BEAR, DENNIS SAID.
01:30:55 BUT WE ALL KNEW AND LOVED HER AS A SOFTIE A WARM
01:30:56 AND ENDEARING COLLEAGUE AND A FIERCELY LOYAL FRIEND.
01:31:00 AT HER RETIREMENT, SHARON SAID SHE COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED
01:31:04 WHAT STARTED AS A PART TIME CITY JOB WOULD LEAD TO WORKING

01:31:15 FAMILY WILL HOLD A PRIVATE CELEBRATION OF HER LIFE AND IN

01:32:24 >> TRUE TO HIS ITALIAN HERITAGE, TIME SPENT WITH

01:32:31 CENTERED AROUND MEALS, LAUGHS AND CHERISHED MOMENTS THAT WILL
01:32:35 LIVE FOREVER WITH THOSE BLESSED ENOUGH TO HAVE TAKEN PART.
01:32:39 >> THE CAPTAIN WAS PROUD WAS A PROUD SAN FRANCISCO NATIVE WHO
01:32:43 GREW UP IN THE VISITATION VALLEY IN EXCELSIOR
01:32:46 NEIGHBORHOODS. HE INTENDED AND GRADUATED FROM
01:32:47 THE ARCHBISHOP REARDON HIGH SCHOOL IN 1982 BEFORE JOINING
01:32:53 THE FIRE SERVICE. THE CAPTAIN WORKED AS A FLORIST
01:32:55 A PROFESSION HE LOVED WITH A PASSION TALENT HE HELD CLOSE
01:32:58 THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. HIS REAL PASSION, HOWEVER, WAS
01:33:02 BECOMING A SAN FRANCISCO FIREFIGHTER.
01:33:05 >> HE BRAVELY ANSWERED THE CALL TO SERVE IN 2000.
01:33:08 DEDICATING 25 YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO THE COMMUNITY SERVING AT
01:33:12 STATIONS TO NINE AND 36 AS WELL AS THE DIVISION OF TRAINING
01:33:16 AND FINISHING IS EXTRAORDINARILY CAREER AS A
01:33:19 CAPTION OF STATION 36 IN DISTRICT FIVE.
01:33:22 >> HE WAS PART OF THE 103RD RECRUITMENT ACADEMY OF THE SAN
01:33:26 FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT AND IN HIS EARLY CAREER SERVED
01:33:29 AS A VACATION RELIEF FIREFIGHTER IN WHICH HE HAD THE
01:33:33 OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AT EVERY FIREHOUSE IN THE CITY EVERY
01:33:36 SINGLE ONE. >> IN 2005 THE CAPTAIN BECAME
01:33:40 AN ENGINE DRIVER UNTIL HE WAS PROMOTED TO LIEUTENANT IN 2012
01:33:43 AT STATION NINE IN THE BAYVIEW .
01:33:47 >> JULIA WAS PROMOTED TO CAPTAIN IN 2018 OF STATION NINE
01:33:50 AND PROMOTED TO CAPTAIN OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING IN 2020
01:33:53 IN WHICH SHE TOUCHED THE LIVES OF MANY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN

01:34:15 BECOMING THE CAPTAIN OF STATION 36.

01:34:19 COMPASSION AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO HIS FAMILY,
01:34:23 COMMUNITY AND TRADITION. HIS STRENGTH IN THE FACE OF
01:34:27 ADVERSITY AND HIS GENEROUS SPIRIT HAVE LEFT AN INDELIBLE
01:34:30 MARK ON ALL WHO KNEW HIM. THE CAPTAIN'S LEGACY WILL
01:34:32 CONTINUE TO INSPIRE AND UPLIFT THOSE WHO ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE
01:34:35 BEEN PART OF HIS LIFE. >> HIS PRESENCE WILL BE

01:35:11 OF THE ENTIRE. NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE

01:35:17 I THINK THE CHIEF WANTS TO OFFER REMARKS ON THE QUESTION
01:35:18 DO WE HAVE THE FLOOR? >> WITHOUT OBJECTION.
01:35:19 GREAT. THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL DO THANK
01:35:22 YOU. PRESIDENT MANDOLIN MEMBERS OF
01:35:25 THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. MADAM SECRETARY, THANK YOU VERY
01:35:29 MUCH FOR HONORING CAPTAIN DELUCA.
01:35:33 HE IS NOTHING SHORT OF A LEGEND IN THIS FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD AN
01:35:35 INNATE ABILITY TO BE A TEACHER AND A STUDENT AT THE SAME TIME
01:35:41 HE TAUGHT AT OUR ACADEMY AND TOUCHED THE LIVES OF EVERY
01:35:43 MEMBER OF THE CROSSES PATH. IN FACT, HIS LEGACY LIVES ON
01:35:49 IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE MEMBERS TO MY LEFT AS THEY
01:35:53 PERFORM A CHALLENGING FUNCTION IN DISTRICT FIVE SERVICING THE
01:35:54 TENDERLOIN AND MISSION SOUTH OF MARKET AREAS ONE OF THE BUSIEST
01:35:58 ENGINE COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES.
01:36:01 IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE OUR ONLY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
01:36:05 UNIT IN SAN FRANCISCO RESPONDING TO UNKNOWN
01:36:08 EMERGENCIES HUNDREDS A YEAR AND PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE
01:36:10 LINE SO WE THANK THESE MEMBERS FOR THEIR SERVICE AS WELL AS
01:36:15 CAPTAIN DELUCA AND HIS FINAL ACT OF KINDNESS OFFERED ONCE HE
01:36:20 CONTRACTED CANCER AND SCORED HIGH ON A CHIEF'S EXAM TO GIVE
01:36:24 HIS PROMOTION TO THE NEXT PERSON ON THE LIST.
01:36:29 THAT'S PRETTY HONORABLE AND WE HONOR HIM AND CHERISH HIM.
01:36:34 HE WILL BE SORELY MISSED. BUT HIS LEGACY LIVES ON
01:36:37 IN ADDITION TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN.
01:36:38 BUT INTERIM AND THE REMAINDER OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
01:36:42 SO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HONOR.
01:36:42 WE APPRECIATE IT. >> THANK YOU, CHIEF.
01:36:45 THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK, FOR FINDING A WAY FOR US TO LET THE
01:36:48 CHIEF SPEAK DURING ROLL CALL AND WE WILL DO THAT IN MEMORIAM
01:36:52 FROM THE FULL BOARD. >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
01:36:56 SUPERVISOR CHERYL, DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA SORRY ABOUT THAT.
01:37:03 COLLEAGUES, TODAY I'D LIKE TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT A RESOLUTION
01:37:07 RECOGNIZING JUNE 6TH AS NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS
01:37:10 DAY HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO. GUN VIOLENCE HAS TAKEN TOO MANY
01:37:14 LIVES, LEFT TOO MANY FAMILIES FOREVER CHANGED.
01:37:17 LAST YEAR NEARLY 47,000 PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WERE KILLED BY
01:37:23 GUNS. 115,000 WERE WOUNDED.
01:37:24 IT IS NOW THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN AND TEENS
01:37:27 IN THE UNITED STATES AND THIS PAIN IS NOT EVENLY SHARED.
01:37:31 >> YOUNG PEOPLE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND URBAN
01:37:35 NEIGHBORHOODS BEAR THE HEAVIEST BURDEN.
01:37:38 BUT THESE ARE NOT JUST NUMBERS. THESE ARE PEOPLE A CHILD, A
01:37:42 PARENT, A FRIEND WHOSE LIVES WERE STOLEN TOO SOON.
01:37:44 >> WE ARE HERE TODAY TO REMEMBER THEM AND TO SAY THAT
01:37:47 THEIR LIVES MATTERED. NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS
01:37:50 DAY WAS CREATED TO HONOR THE LIFE OF HADIYA PENDLETON, A 15
01:37:54 YEAR OLD GIRL WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED WHILE STANDING IN A
01:37:58 PLAYGROUND WITH HER CLASSMATES. HER FRIENDS CHOSE TO WORE
01:38:01 ORANGE IN HER MEMORY. THE COLOR HUNTERS WERE FOR
01:38:03 SAFETY AND STARTED A MOVEMENT THAT HAS REACHED ACROSS THE
01:38:06 COUNTRY. ON JUNE 6TH THIS FRIDAY WE'LL
01:38:09 WEAR ORANGE IN HONOR OF THE LIVES WE'VE LOST AND IN
01:38:12 SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE STILL GRIEVING AND STILL PUSHING FOR
01:38:16 CHANGE. >> HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE
01:38:17 MADE REAL PROGRESS. LAST YEAR WE SAW THE LOWEST
01:38:21 NUMBER OF HOMICIDES SINCE THE 1960S AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE
01:38:24 INVESTED IN SAFETY, IN PREVENTION, IN TRUSTED
01:38:28 COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND IN PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES TO
01:38:30 VIOLENCE. >> BUT THE WORK IS FAR FROM
01:38:31 OVER. PREVENTING GUN VIOLENCE MEANS
01:38:35 DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. PASSING STRONGER LAWS
01:38:38 SUPPORTING SURVIVORS. REMOVING GUNS FROM DANGEROUS
01:38:42 SITUATIONS AND BUILDING TRUST WHERE IT'S BEEN BROKEN.
01:38:46 I'M GRATEFUL TO SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO JOINED ME
01:38:47 IN CO-SPONSORING THIS RESOLUTION.
01:38:50 I WANT TO THANK MY PREDECESSOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CATHERINE
01:38:52 STEPHANIE FOR HER VERY, VERY STRONG LEGACY ON THIS ISSUE.
01:38:55 SHE LED ON GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION HERE IN DISTRICT
01:38:58 TWO AND CONTINUES THAT WORK TODAY AT THE STATE.
01:39:01 I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE ADVOCATES, THE FRONTLINE
01:39:03 WORKERS AND THE FAMILIES WHO CARRY THIS FIGHT FORWARD EVERY
01:39:06 DAY. YOUR COURAGE, YOUR FIERCE
01:39:09 COMMITMENT TO THIS WORK ARE AN INSPIRATION.
01:39:10 I HAVE PROFOUND ADMIRATION FOR THE WAY YOU TURN YOUR GRIEF
01:39:13 INTO POWER TO INSPIRE LASTING CHANGE.
01:39:17 >> SAN FRANCISCO STANDS WITH YOU.
01:39:18 WE WON'T LOOK AWAY AND WE WON'T GIVE UP.
01:39:21 >> SECOND TODAY I'M INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION URGING THE SAN
01:39:25 FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY
01:39:27 MANAGEMENT TO CLASSIFY ALL 911 CALLS REGARDING ILLICIT DRUG
01:39:30 ACTIVITY WITHIN 1500 FEET OF PARKS, PLAYGROUNDS AND SCHOOLS
01:39:37 AS PRIORITY A EMERGENCIES. >> THESE AREAS ARE WHERE OUR
01:39:40 COMMUNITY, CHILDREN AND FAMILIES GATHER AND THEY
01:39:41 DESERVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SAFETY.
01:39:44 THIS RESOLUTION CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO SAFEGUARD
01:39:48 PUBLIC SAFETY AND SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE WE WILL NOT TOLERATE
01:39:51 OPEN DRUG ACTIVITY IN PUBLIC SPACES WHERE OUR CHILDREN PLAY
01:39:55 AND LEARN. PARENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO
01:39:56 THINK TWICE ABOUT TAKING THEIR KIDS TO THE PARK.
01:40:00 >> FAMILIES SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WALKING TO SCHOOL.
01:40:03 A CHILD'S SAFETY SHOULD NEVER BE PUT ON HOLD.
01:40:04 IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT PROTECTING CHILDREN WE NEED TO
01:40:07 RESPOND WITH URGENCY WHEN THEIR SAFETY IS AT RISK.
01:40:10 WE HEAR FROM FAMILIES ACROSS THE CITY WHO ARE TRYING TO
01:40:11 RAISE THEIR KIDS IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT TOO OFTEN BASIC
01:40:15 SAFETY FEELS LIKE AN AFTERTHOUGHT.
01:40:18 >> THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT BEING CLEAR THAT THE SAFETY OF
01:40:22 CHILDREN AND THE LIVABILITY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IS NOT
01:40:23 NEGOTIABLE. WHEN A PARENT CALLS FOR HELP,
01:40:27 THE CITY NEEDS TO SHOW UP QUICKLY AND CONSISTENTLY
01:40:30 BECAUSE OUR CHILDREN DESERVE TO GROW UP IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT
01:40:33 FEEL SAFE AND CARED FOR. THAT STARTS WITH SHOWING UP
01:40:37 WHEN FAMILIES CALL FOR HELP. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING OUR CITY'S
01:40:38 PRIORITIES CLEAR AND PUTTING THEM INTO ACTION.
01:40:42 >> FINALLY, I'D LIKE TO ADJOURN TODAY'S MEETING IN MEMORY OF
01:40:46 WILLIAM JOSEPH HEEP, A BELOVED DISTRICT TWO COMMUNITY MEMBER
01:40:49 AND A COMMITTED VOLUNTEER FOR THE LAFAYETTE PARK CONSERVATION
01:40:53 PROGRAM. BILL WAS A LOVING, FUNNY,
01:40:56 CULTURED, SENSITIVE, KIND AND LOYAL BROTHER UNCLE
01:41:00 AND FRIEND. HE WAS A MAN OF INTEGRITY
01:41:03 AND HONESTY WHO SADLY PASSED AWAY ON FEBRUARY 23RD OF THIS
01:41:06 YEAR. HE IS SURVIVED BY HIS SIBLINGS
01:41:09 ,HIS NIECES AND NEPHEWS AND MANY, MANY CLOSE PERSONAL
01:41:14 FRIENDS MANY OF WHOM REMAIN ACTIVE IN THE LAFAYETTE PARK
01:41:18 COMMUNITY. BUT BEYOND HIS ROLE IN THE
01:41:19 CONSERVATION PROGRAM, BILL WAS AN AVID READER, GARDENER
01:41:22 AND PRESENCE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
01:41:23 KNOWN FOR A KINDHEARTED, GENEROUS SPIRIT AND IN
01:41:26 APPRECIATION OF A REALLY GOOD BOTTLE OF WINE.
01:41:29 I WANT TO EXTEND MY CONDOLENCES TO HIS FRIENDS AND TO HIS
01:41:33 FAMILY FOR THEIR LOSS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO JOINING THE
01:41:34 LAFAYETTE PARK COMMUNITY THIS SATURDAY TO MEMORIALIZE BILL
01:41:37 AND HONOR HIS MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARK
01:41:40 AND OUR CITY. >> THE REST I SUBMIT THANK YOU
01:41:41 SUPERVISORS. >> SHERYL.
01:41:44 MR. PRESIDENT, SEEING NO OTHER NAMES ON THE ROSTER THAT
01:41:46 CONCLUDES THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW BUSINESS.
01:41:49 >> RIGHT. LET'S GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT
01:41:52 THIS TIME THE BOARD WELCOMES YOUR PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU LINE
01:41:53 UP ON YOUR RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE CHAMBER NEAR THE CURTAINS
01:41:57 YOU MAY SPEAK TO THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD MEETING MINUTES AS
01:42:00 PRESENTED THE. >> FOR ADOPTION WITHOUT A
01:42:04 COMMITTEE REFERENCE ITEMS 31 AND 32 ALL OTHER ITEMS THAT
01:42:07 HAVE BEEN REPORTED OUT BY THE BOARD BY AN APPROPRIATE
01:42:12 COMMITTEE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE SPOKEN ABOUT BUT YOU CAN
01:42:15 SPEAK TO GENERAL MATTERS. WE'RE SETTING THE TIMER FOR TWO
01:42:18 MINUTES. WELCOME CHRIS.
01:42:19 AS FOR SPEAKER TODAY GOOD AFTERNOON BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
01:42:22 PRESIDENT FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS CHRIS WARD KLEIN.
01:42:25 I ALSO GO BY SERGEANT KLEIN OF THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS
01:42:27 ACTIVE DUTY. YESTERDAY I SPOKE AT THE HEALTH
01:42:29 COMMISSION. ITEM FIVE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT
01:42:32 YOUR TEAMS GO BACK AND LISTEN TO THAT PUBLIC COMMENT ON ITEM
01:42:35 FIVE. BASICALLY THE BUDGET THE CITY
01:42:39 IS ELIGIBLE TO GET 5 BILLION PLUS DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL
01:42:43 GOVERNMENT WITH UNCLAIMED DAMAGES AND THE CITY ATTORNEY'S
01:42:47 OFFICE DOESN'T WANT TO SUBMIT THIS BECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE
01:42:51 NAMED IN AN INDICTMENT FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
01:42:54 AND THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HURT SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE WE NEED
01:42:55 THAT MONEY. AND AGAIN, I WOULD STRONGLY
01:42:58 SUGGEST THAT YOU GET WITH THE MAYOR GREG WAGNER AND MAYBE
01:43:02 JESSE SMITH BRING HIM BACK AS THE INTERIM CITY ATTORNEY
01:43:06 AND REWORK THE BUDGET WITH THE $5 BILLION.
01:43:11 GLYDE NEEDS THAT MONEY. SALVATION ARMY NEEDS THAT
01:43:14 MONEY. EVERYBODY NEEDS THAT MONEY
01:43:15 AND WE CANNOT LAY OFF 1500 PEOPLE THAT WOULD SET US INTO A
01:43:17 DEPRESSION WHICH WOULD BE A DOMINO EFFECT ACROSS THE CITY,
01:43:21 ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
01:43:24 THE ISSUE IS THAT PEOPLE. SEVERAL THEN IT WENT TO A DOZEN
01:43:28 THEN IT WENT TO 2 OR 3 DOZENS. WE GET A HOLD OF CREDENTIALS
01:43:35 AND THEN THEY TO GO FIND A CORPORATION OR A UNIVERSITY OR
01:43:38 A DIFFERENT STATE OR A DIFFERENT COUNTRY TO GIVE THEM
01:43:40 ACCESS WITH THAT ACCESS THEY ALLOWED OTHER PEOPLE THIRD
01:43:46 PARTY COUNTRIES TO COME IN WITH THEIR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS THE
01:43:47 CYBER STALK PEOPLE. THAT SAID UNFAVORABLE THINGS TO
01:43:50 THE PRESIDENT TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, TO THE MAYOR THAT
01:43:55 WAS CAUSING YOUR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, THAT WAS CAUSING YOUR
01:43:58 OVERDOSES. THIS IS COMING OUT I'M WORKING
01:44:01 WITH THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
01:44:03 AND THE MARINE CORPS THIS IS COMING OUT FOR REFERENCE.
01:44:06 YOU CAN GO BACK AND GOOGLE AUDRA.
01:44:10 WHEN THE UNIVERSITIES WERE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING
01:44:13 AND IT GOT VERY UGLY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
01:44:14 THANK YOU. HAVE A GOOD DAY.
01:44:15 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> LET'S WELCOME OUR NEXT
01:44:19 SPEAKER. >> YOU'RE BOTH COMING UP TO THE
01:44:22 PODIUM. YOU'LL EACH HAVE YOUR OWN TWO
01:44:25 MINUTES. >> I CAN.
01:44:28 >> MY APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE. MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE NOT
01:44:33 RELATED TO THE AGENDA PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN OF.
01:44:39 FIRST OFF, AS I WALKED INTO THE BUILDING AT THE SECURITY CHECK
01:44:43 AND I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A HAT WITH JINGLING BELLS AND RED
01:44:47 SQUEAKY NOSE PERHAPS THE MAN WHO WAS ESCORTED.
01:44:51 FROM THE PREMISES EARLIER TODAY COULD BE CONNECTED WITH HIS
01:44:52 BELONGINGS. I HOPE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
01:44:55 CAN HELP WITH THAT. MY NAME IS JOHN PAUL UP
01:45:00 AND JANI. I'M A PARTNER AT SUTRO POWER, A
01:45:03 LOCAL SOLAR AND BATTERY INSTALLATION FIRM AND I'M HERE
01:45:04 TO MAKE A PLEA ON BEHALF OF OUR LOCAL INDUSTRY.
01:45:07 IN 2018 THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS COMMITTED TO
01:45:11 AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR CLEAN ENERGY AND SAN FRANCISCO
01:45:12 SPECIFIC ONLY A 100% RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY BY 2030 AND NET
01:45:17 ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2040. I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SAY
01:45:21 THAT SAN FRANCISCO IS BACKSLIDING ON THOSE
01:45:24 COMMITMENTS. >> THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
01:45:26 THE POTENTIAL ERASURE OF THE 30% TAX CREDIT AT THE FEDERAL
01:45:29 LEVEL NOR WITH CALIFORNIA'S RECENT SLASHING OF SOLAR
01:45:33 COMPENSATION RATES. THE PROBLEM IS OUR OWN CITIES
01:45:38 PERMITTING PROCESSES AND HOW IT HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY ALTERED
01:45:43 IN THE PAST TEN MONTHS. SAN FRANCISCO HAS SLID QUITE A
01:45:44 BIT FROM BEING ONE OF THE MOST SENSIBLE AND EXPEDIENT
01:45:48 JURISDICTIONS TO DO SOLAR AND BATTERY IN THE NATION.
01:45:51 PROPERTY OWNERS AND RENTERS LIVING IN CONDOS AND APARTMENTS
01:45:55 WITH MORE THAN TWO UNITS ARE THE MOST IMPACTED WITH A
01:45:59 POSSIBLE LOSS OF THE TAX CREDIT THIS YEAR WE MAY HAVE TO STOP
01:46:03 TAKING ON THESE PROJECTS ENTIRELY DUE TO THE PERMITTING
01:46:06 HURDLES. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT
01:46:08 MY INTENTION TO CRITICIZE ANY CITY WORKER OR DEPARTMENT.
01:46:11 >> THE PROBLEM IS STRUCTURAL AND TOP DOWN THERE IS NO
01:46:14 CENTRALIZED CLEAR FRAMEWORK GUIDING HOW THESE PERMANENT
01:46:16 RULES ARE PROPOSED, REVIEWED OR IMPLEMENTED AND INPUT FROM OUR
01:46:20 LOCAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN TOTALLY EXCLUDED.
01:46:23 I URGE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT
01:46:26 STATE OF SOLAR AND BATTERY PERMITTING IN SAN FRANCISCO.
01:46:29 CONSULT WITH S.F. BASED COMPANIES AS WELL AS ESTABLISH
01:46:33 PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD. >> WORK WITH US TO CRAFT A
01:46:35 COHERENT AND THANK YOU SIR. THE TIMES CONCLUDED THANK YOU.
01:46:41 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER
01:46:48 . >> HELLO MY NAME IS FAITH

01:47:20 LANGUAGES AND THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES.
01:47:21 AND THEN ADVOCATING FOR AND SHARING THEIR FINDINGS WITH
01:47:24 THEIR COMMUNITIES IS A CRUCIAL PART OF ADDRESSING FOOD
01:47:28 INSECURITY NEEDS. >> REVENUE FROM THE SOURCES

01:47:47 LEADS TO BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES BY REDUCING CHRONIC
01:47:51 HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.
01:47:55 >> THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ACADEMY IS A SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR
01:47:58 COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PROCESS AND HEAL FROM THE IMPACTS OF
01:48:00 SYSTEMIC RACISM AND HEALTH INEQUITIES.

01:49:11 TIMES A WEEK. A $5 FEE WOULD EQUATE TO ABOUT
01:49:13 700 TO $1100 PER YEAR A COST THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
01:49:18 AFFORD NOR COULD SAN FRANCISCO YOUTH OR LOW INCOME PLAYERS
01:49:21 IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS FEE WAS PRIMARILY BACKED
01:49:25 BY PARKS AND RECS ALLIANCE, A GROUP WHO JUST MISUSED $3.8
01:49:28 MILLION IN RESTRICTED FUNDS THIS PAST YEAR AND ARE NOW
01:49:31 SHUTTING DOWN AND WITHOUT AN AUDIT HOW CAN WE TRUST THAT THE
01:49:35 BACKING FOR THESE FEES WOULD BE IN GOOD FAITH FOR THIS MEASURE
01:49:38 ? THERE ARE BETTER SOLUTIONS
01:49:39 WITHOUT FINANCIAL BARRIERS SUCH AS NO SHOW PENALTIES.
01:49:42 COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS I WATCH THIS CHAMBER ADMIRE THE GRACE
01:49:46 AND LEADERSHIP OF A LOT OF OTHERS THIS AFTERNOON
01:49:48 AND RESPECTFULLY I ASK THAT YOU GIVE ME AND MY COMMUNITY THAT
01:49:50 SAME FEELING TOWARD YOURSELVES BY VOTING NOW AND NOT STIFLING
01:49:54 WHAT WE'VE ALL BUILT TOGETHER SO LET'S KEEP OUR PUBLIC SPACES
01:49:57 FREE AND ALLOW COMMUNITY AND CIVIC WELLNESS TO FLOURISH
01:50:00 IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. >> THANK YOU.
01:50:01 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT
01:50:05 SPEAKER. WELCOME.
01:50:09 >> HELLO DEAR SUPERVISORS, MY NAME IS ELAINA.
01:50:12 I AM ALSO A PROUD MEMBER OF THE MISSION ATHLETICS CLUB.
01:50:16 I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE PROPOSED $5 COURT RESERVATION
01:50:20 FEE. THIS POLICY WOULD BURDEN THE
01:50:23 VERY COMMUNITIES THESE COURTS ARE MEANT TO SERVE WHILE
01:50:25 OFFERING LITTLE FINANCIAL BENEFIT AND CREATING MAJOR
01:50:28 LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES. >> FREE PUBLIC COURTS HAVE BEEN
01:50:31 A VITAL PART OF REBUILDING MY COMMUNITY AFTER AFTER RETURNING
01:50:35 TO US FROM SEATTLE, THE SENSE OF BELONGING CAME FROM OPEN
01:50:39 ACCESS NOT A PAYWALL $5 AN HOUR FEE WOULD EQUATE TO ABOUT AS MY
01:50:51 PREVIOUS CALLER MENTIONED 1100 A YEAR WHICH IS UNAFFORDABLE
01:50:57 FOR MANY ESPECIALLY IN A CITY WHERE 100,000 IS CONSIDERED LOW
01:51:01 INCOME. PARKS AND REC HAS SHARED NO
01:51:04 SOLID DATA TO JUSTIFY THIS FEE .
01:51:07 >> THIS PROPOSAL IS BACKED BY GROUPS UNDER FINANCIAL SCRUTINY
01:51:12 RISKS SETTING PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE PRICE HIKES AND REDUCED
01:51:15 PARTICIPATION. THERE ARE BETTER SOLUTIONS SO
01:51:20 PLEASE VOTE NO TO KEEP OUR COURTS FREE, PUBLIC
01:51:21 AND ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR
01:51:24 CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
01:51:28 WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> HELLO SUPERVISORS.
01:51:36 IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU ALL. MY NAME IS IAN JAMES.
01:51:39 I AM THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MANAGER AT GLIDE CENTER FOR
01:51:42 SOCIAL JUSTICE. I AM ALSO HERE TO TALK ABOUT
01:51:44 THE FUNDING FOR A DEEP. SUGARY DRINK DISTRIBUTOR TAX OR
01:51:47 SODA TAX FUNDED PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE BEEN CUT IN THE CURRENT
01:51:51 DRAFT OF THE BUDGET. >> SOME OF YOU WILL REMEMBER
01:51:55 THAT WE WERE HERE LAST YEAR WHEN THIS FUNDING WAS ALSO CUT.
01:51:59 COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS CAME FROM ACROSS SAN FRANCISCO
01:52:03 D FIVE D TEN D 11 TO CITY HALL TO SHARE STORIES OF HOW THIS
01:52:08 MONEY SUPPORTS LOCAL FARMS GETS FOOD TO HUNGRY FAMILIES,
01:52:13 NURTURES NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND SUPPORTS EMERGING
01:52:15 LEADERS AND ADVOCATES. COMMUNITY MEMBERS MADE THE TREK
01:52:17 TO SHARE THROUGH PUBLIC COMMENT HOW THESE PROGRAMS HAVE CHANGED
01:52:22 THEIR LIVES AND ONE YEAR LATER THAT WORK IS STILL HAPPENING
01:52:25 AND IS STILL VITAL. >> AND I'M REALLY DEVASTATED
01:52:28 THAT WE ARE BACK HERE AGAIN FIGHTING FOR THEIR SURVIVAL
01:52:33 IN THE TENDERLOIN GLIDE AND DC WERE AWARDED FUNDING TO
01:52:36 CONTINUE OUR SOCIAL JUSTICE ACADEMY.
01:52:37 AND FOOD POLICY COUNCIL RESPECTIVELY.
01:52:40 THESE ARE ESSENTIAL TO UNDERLYING SPACES FOR ENSURING
01:52:43 THAT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES HAVE A VOICE IN RESOLVING THE
01:52:45 HEALTH ISSUES THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT THEM.
01:52:48 AND CLYDE SPECIFICALLY WAS PLANNING ON USING THESE FUNDS
01:52:52 TO SUPPORT BLACK COMMUNITIES IN ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY.
01:52:55 CHRONIC HEALTH INEQUITIES THROUGH COMMUNITY BUILDING,
01:52:56 RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY FIRSTHAND I HAVE
01:52:59 SEEN IN PROGRAMS LIKE THIS ONE AND THE PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE
01:53:07 SODA TAX RELIEF CONNECTION HEALING BONDS FORM ACROSS
01:53:10 DIFFERENCES. THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT TRAUMA
01:53:13 AND THE EMERGENCE OF TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP.
01:53:15 THESE OUTCOMES ARE REAL AND THEY ARE CRUCIAL IF SAN
01:53:18 FRANCISCO IS ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO TRULY HEALTHY COMMUNITIES
01:53:21 BEYOND SIMPLY MANAGING THE MOST VISIBLE SYMPTOMS OF INEQUITY.
01:53:25 SO PLEASE SUPERVISORS AS YOU CRAFT THE FINAL VERSION OF OUR
01:53:29 CITY'S BUDGET INCLUDE THE ESSENTIAL FUNDING FOR SODA TAX
01:53:32 GRANTS SO PROGRAMS LIKE OURS CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST.
01:53:34 THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
01:53:37 WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> GOOD AFTERNOON SUPERVISORS.
01:53:43 I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH ALL
01:53:46 OF YOU AT ONCE. MY NAME IS APPLE KRONK.
01:53:47 I AM A MEMBER OF THIS COHORT FOR GLIDE SOCIAL JUSTICE
01:53:51 ACADEMY AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT I AM PROFOUNDLY
01:53:55 SAD TO HEAR THAT THIS PROGRAM IS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK FOR AT
01:53:58 LEAST THE NEXT FEW YEARS. I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT
01:54:02 ABOUT WHAT THIS PROGRAM HAS DONE FOR ME.
01:54:03 >> PLEADING THAT YOU'LL RECONSIDER.
01:54:05 I HAVE A BEEN A RESIDENT OF SAN FRANCISCO FOR OVER 19 YEARS.
01:54:08 MUCH OF THAT TIME I SPENT LIVING ON THE STREETS
01:54:09 STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE AND USING SUBSTANCES TO COPE WITH
01:54:12 PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA OF MY PAST AND THE DESTITUTE BROKENNESS OF
01:54:16 MY PRESENT. LIVING IN THE SHADOWS OF THIS
01:54:19 COMMUNITY AND MAKING MY HOME WITHIN THE CRACKED CONCRETE
01:54:21 CONCRETE MARGINS OF THIS BEAUTIFUL THRIVING COMMUNITY OF
01:54:24 ART, CULTURE AND WEALTH I FELT ALL BUT INVISIBLE YET BEFORE
01:54:28 YOU HERE I STAND IN ACTIVIST AND ADVOCATE A MOTHER OF A
01:54:31 BEAUTIFUL TWO YEAR OLD MIRACLE HERE AND NOW BEFORE YOU CLEAN.
01:54:34 NOT MERELY ON THE SURFACE OR BY.
01:54:35 THE BLOOD IN MY VEINS BUT IN MY SOUL.
01:54:38 I'VE BEEN SOBER FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW RENT AN APARTMENT
01:54:42 IN DISTRICT SEVEN WITH MY PARTNER AND DAUGHTER.
01:54:43 IT WAS IT WAS THANKS TO SOME OF MANY INCREDIBLE PROGRAMS THAT
01:54:46 EXIST HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT I SURVIVED AND MADE IT
01:54:48 HERE TO THIS. STAGE OF MY RECOVERY.
01:54:50 BUT I WOULDN'T EVEN BE SHARING ANY OF THIS WITH YOU IF IT WERE
01:54:53 NOT FOR THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ACADEMY HELPING ME TO FIND MY
01:54:55 VOICE AND GIVING ME A SENSE OF VALUE FOR THE UNIQUE
01:54:58 EXPERIENCES THAT I'VE HAD. SOCIAL JUSTICE ACADEMY HELPED
01:55:01 ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHARE MY STORY TO INFORM POLICYMAKERS
01:55:04 LIKE YOURSELVES HOW TO BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THIS
01:55:09 COMMUNITY WHO CONTEND WITH SIMILAR HARDSHIPS AS I HAD.
01:55:10 >> SO AS WE FIGHT FOR POSITIVE CHANGES WE MUST DEFEND
01:55:14 AND UPLIFT THE INCREDIBLE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS WHICH GIVE
01:55:17 FOLKS LIKE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND THEIR VOICE, FIND THEIR
01:55:20 NICHE AND MAKE PROFOUND CHANGES IN THEIR COMMUNITY.
01:55:22 >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
01:55:24 LET'S WELCOME OUR NEXT SPEAKER .
01:55:27 >> GOOD AFTERNOON ESTEEMED BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LEADERS.
01:55:32 >> MY NAME IS LINDA MANTELL AND I AM A MEMBER OF THE GLIDE
01:55:39 COMMUNITY CHURCH, THE GLIDE MEMORIAL CHURCH AND I'VE BEEN
01:55:43 LIVING AND WORKING IN THE TENDERLOIN FOR NEARLY 50 YEARS
01:55:46 . I'M A 35 YEAR MEMBER OF THE
01:55:47 GLIDE FAMILY AND A CURRENT MEMBER OF THE GLIDE CHURCH
01:55:50 BOARD AND ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES I WOULD URGE YOU NOT
01:55:54 TO CUT THE FUNDING FOR THE SODA TAX FUNDED PROGRAM.
01:55:58 THE GLIDE CENTER FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AS YOU WERE JUST TOLD,
01:56:02 IS AN ESSENTIAL PROGRAM FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
01:56:05 AND SO I WOULD ASK YOU SIMPLY NOT TO CUT THE FUNDS THAT WOULD
01:56:09 ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM.
01:56:10 >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
01:56:13 WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> GOOD AFTERNOON ESTEEMED
01:56:17 BOARD. MY NAME IS TOBY SACHS QUINTANA.
01:56:21 I'M A RESIDENT OF SAN FRANCISCO AND DISTRICT EIGHT AND A MEMBER
01:56:25 OF THE MISSION ATHLETIC CLUB THAT GREW ALMOST ENTIRELY OUT
01:56:28 OF FREE ACCESS TO OUR PUBLIC COURTS.
01:56:32 >> I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE $5 FEE THAT WILL GO ON TO THE
01:56:38 COURTS. BECAUSE WE'LL IMPACT THOSE THAT
01:56:42 THAT NEED IT MOST WORKING FAMILIES, SENIORS, STUDENTS,
01:56:46 THOSE AFFECTED BY LAYOFFS DUE TO ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND AND
01:56:50 THOSE AFFECTED BY RECENT LAYOFFS IN TECH AND THE MISSION
01:56:54 ATHLETIC CLUB HAS GIVEN ME A REAL THIRD SPACE TO MEET PEOPLE
01:56:57 THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE MET OTHERWISE AND TO BUILD
01:57:01 COMMUNITY. I FEEL LIKE ATHLETICS
01:57:02 AND SPORTS IS A WAY THAT TRANSCENDS BOUNDARIES LIKE VERY
01:57:05 FEW THINGS CAN AND I FEEL LIKE BECAUSE OF THE MISSION ATHLETIC
01:57:09 CLUB AND OUR FREE COURTS I HAVE MY PLACE IN THE BEAUTIFUL
01:57:13 MOSAIC THAT IS SAN FRANCISCO AND NOW TO THE FEE REX AND PARK
01:57:20 HAVE PREDICATED THIS FEE ON NO SHOWS WE ARE YET TO SEE THE
01:57:24 DATA ON THOSE SHOWS. IT'S ALSO BACKED THIS FEE BY
01:57:28 THE PARKS ALLIANCE WHICH WAS RECENTLY EXPOSED FOR MISUSING
01:57:32 MILLIONS OF FUNDS. >> I'D LIKE TO THANK SUPERVISOR
01:57:36 FIELDER FOR PROPOSING AN AUDIT TO SAN FRANCISCO REC AND PARKS
01:57:40 AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO SEE WHAT TURNS OUT IN THAT
01:57:44 AUDIT ON REX AND PARKS AND THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE
01:57:48 PARKS ALLIANCE. >> WE ALSO NEED BROADER
01:57:51 COMMUNITY INPUT AND THERE ARE BETTER SOLUTIONS SUCH AS
01:57:55 CORPORATE SPONSORSHIPS, PRIVATE LESSON FEES AND OTHER WAYS TO
01:57:59 GENERATE REVENUE WITHOUT PUNISHING EVERYDAY PLAYERS.
01:58:02 >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
01:58:05 >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER .
01:58:09 HELLO SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS MAY AND I'M A SAN
01:58:13 FRANCISCO RESIDENT AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE MISSION ATHLETIC
01:58:17 CLUB HERE TO ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE PROPOSED $5 TENNIS COURT
01:58:20 RESERVATION FEE PUBLIC ACCESS MATTERS DEEPLY TO ME.
01:58:25 >> I ONLY STARTED PLAYING TENNIS BECAUSE IT WAS FREE IF
01:58:29 THERE HAD BEEN A FEE EVEN JUST FIVE DOLLARS I WOULD HAVE NEVER
01:58:32 PICKED UP A RACKET LIKE MANY PEOPLE I DIDN'T GROW UP PLAYING
01:58:36 . I DIDN'T HAVE THE GEAR.
01:58:37 I CERTAINLY DIDN'T THINK OF TENNIS AS ACCESSIBLE BUT FREE
01:58:40 PUBLIC COURTS AND FREE TENNIS PROGRAMS PUT ON BY COMMUNITIES
01:58:44 LIKE THE MISSION ATHLETIC CLUB CHANGE THAT THEY GAVE ME A WAY
01:58:48 TO MOVE TO CONNECT WITH OTHERS AND TO FEEL PART OF THE CITY.
01:58:51 >> I FEEL A VITALIZED AND A SENSE OF BELONGING TO SAN
01:58:55 FRANCISCO BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITY I'VE BUILT THANKS TO
01:58:58 THE FREE PUBLIC PARK ACCESS A $5 FEE MIGHT SEEM SMALL BUT IT
01:59:03 CREATES A REAL BARRIER FOR BEGINNERS STUDENTS AND ANYONE
01:59:07 UNSURE IF THEY BELONG ON A COURT.
01:59:11 IT TELLS PEOPLE THIS SPACE ISN'T FOR YOU UNLESS YOU
01:59:14 ALREADY PLAY UNLESS YOU HAVE THE MONEY AND THAT GOES AGAINST
01:59:18 WHAT PUBLIC PARKS SHOULD STAND FOR OPENNESS, EQUITY
01:59:21 AND COMMUNITY. >> WE DON'T NEED TO CHARGE THE
01:59:25 PUBLIC TO PRESERVE OUR PARKS. >> THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO
01:59:26 MANAGE ACCESS WITHOUT SHUTTING PEOPLE OUT.
01:59:29 PLEASE PROTECT THE SPIRIT OF PUBLIC PLAY AND VOTE NO ON THIS
01:59:33 FEE. >> THANK YOU.
01:59:36 >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
01:59:40 >> HELLO SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS ARGIN.
01:59:45 I'M A SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENT AND MEMBER OF THE MISSION
01:59:48 ATHLETIC CLUB. AND I ALSO URGE YOU TO VOTE NO
01:59:50 ON THE $5 PER HOUR COURT RESERVATION FEE.
01:59:53 >> THIS FEE BURDENS THE WRONG PEOPLE GENERATE A LITTLE BIT
01:59:57 JUST SO IT GENERATES A LITTLE REVENUE AND IS OPERATIONALLY
02:00:00 FLAWED. >> SO THE TENNIS COURTS HAVE
02:00:03 SERVED AS A WAY FOR ME TO CONNECT WITH THE ROOTS OF MY
02:00:05 COMMUNITY AND STRENGTHEN LOCAL TIMES LOCAL TIES.
02:00:08 >> I FEEL LIKE A REAL SAN FRANCISCAN WHEN LIKE I WENT TO
02:00:13 A LOCAL RESTAURANT POST HATING AND ASKED ME DO YOU WANT TO GET
02:00:17 THE USUAL? OR THE ART GALLERY OWNER NEXT
02:00:20 DOOR RECOGNIZE ME WALKING BY WITH MY TENNIS GEAR AND JACKET.
02:00:23 AND THAT SENSE OF BELONGING COMES FROM HAVING ACCESS TO
02:00:27 THESE FREE COURTS. AND AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE
02:00:30 MENTIONED, THIS IDEA WAS PRIMARILY BACKED BY THE S.F.
02:00:34 PARKS ALLIANCE AND S.F. TENNIS COALITION AND AS YOU KNOW, THEY
02:00:37 MISUSED ALMOST $4 MILLION IN RESTRICTED FUNDS LAST YEAR.
02:00:41 AND AS A POTENTIAL YESTERDAY WE'LL BE SHUTTING DOWN SHORTLY.
02:00:45 AND RECENTLY SUPERVISOR FIELDER CALLED FOR AN AUDIT ON THE RECS
02:00:48 SAME PARK AS WELL. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN
02:00:52 TRUST THE BACKING OF THESE FEES WAS MADE WITH GOOD FAITH WHEN
02:00:56 ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE COLLAPSING BEHIND THEM.
02:00:59 AND THIS $5 FEE EQUALS AROUND 800 TO ALMOST $1,200 A YEAR FOR
02:01:03 REGULARS AND IS UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY YOUTH, SENIORS AND LOW
02:01:07 INCOME RESIDENTS. 100,000 IS CONSIDERED LOW
02:01:11 INCOME IN SAN FRANCISCO AND RECS AND PARKS HAVE OFFERED
02:01:15 ONLY ANECDOTES ABOUT REVENUE NO SHOWS IN UTILIZATION AND HASN'T
02:01:19 PRESENTED ANY SOLID DATA. I BELIEVE THIS FEE WOULD REDUCE
02:01:22 OR REDUCE USAGE AT SATELLITE COURTS AND PAVE THE WAY FOR
02:01:26 PRICE CREEP AS WE'VE SEEN AT THE GOLDMAN TENNIS CENTER.
02:01:30 AND MONITORING WEATHER AND ENFORCING THESE FEES WOULD
02:01:33 BE VERY COSTLY AND COMPLEX. SO YEAH, PLEASE I URGE YOU TO
02:01:37 VOTE NO AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
02:01:38 >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS .
02:01:41 >> LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
02:01:45 GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. MY NAME IS DR. DINA ABDO
02:01:49 AND I'M A SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENT, A PEDIATRICIAN
02:01:52 AND ALSO A PROUD MEMBER OF THE MISSION ATHLETIC CLUB WHICH AS
02:01:56 YOU ALL HAVE HEARD IS A VOLUNTEER LED TENNIS COMMUNITY
02:01:58 THAT GREW ENTIRELY THROUGH FREE PUBLIC COURT ACCESS.
02:02:01 AND I AM ALSO HERE TO URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE PROPOSED $5
02:02:07 COURT RESERVATION AND FEE I JOINED THE MISSION ATHLETIC
02:02:08 CLUB DURING ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE AND EXHAUSTING PERIODS
02:02:12 OF MY MEDICAL RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM.
02:02:15 THE ABILITY TO WALK ONTO A FREE PUBLIC COURT NO SIGN UP, NO
02:02:20 COST FELT LIKE A LIFELINE TO ME.
02:02:23 TENNIS BECAME MY OUTLET FOR MANAGING STRESS, STAYING
02:02:27 PHYSICALLY ACTIVE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BUILDING GENUINE
02:02:30 FRIENDSHIPS OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL.
02:02:31 >> THE EXPERIENCE HAS PROFOUNDLY IMPROVED BOTH MY
02:02:35 PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. AND I KNOW I'M NOT ALONE
02:02:39 IN THAT. AS A PHYSICIAN I SEE FIRSTHAND
02:02:40 HOW ESSENTIAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS TO IMPROVING MENTAL
02:02:43 AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. >> TENNIS IS A LIFELONG SPORT
02:02:46 THAT BUILDS COORDINATION, IMPROVES CARDIOVASCULAR
02:02:49 FITNESS, REDUCES ANXIETY, FOSTERS CONFIDENCE
02:02:54 AND CONNECTION, MAKING IT LESS ACCESSIBLE THROUGH IMPOSING A
02:02:58 COURT FEE WOULD BE A DIRECT BLOW TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF
02:03:01 OUR COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO. >> THERE ARE BETTER, MORE
02:03:03 EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS THAT DON'T IMPOSE FINANCIAL BARRIERS SO
02:03:07 PLEASE VOTE NO ON THIS FEE. HELP US PROTECT PUBLIC ACCESS
02:03:11 AND PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES LIKE THE MISSION ATHLETIC CLUB
02:03:15 THAT ARE HELPING SAN FRANCISCO NOT JUST PLAY BUT HEAL.
02:03:19 >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
02:03:22 >> LET'S WELCOME OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
02:03:25 >> HI SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS BELINDA HONG.
02:03:26 I'VE BEEN A RESIDENT OF SAN FRANCISCO FOR EIGHT YEARS
02:03:30 AND FOR THE PAST YEAR HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE MISSION
02:03:33 ATHLETIC CLUB. AND TODAY I'M HERE TO URGE YOU
02:03:34 TO HELP PROTECT OUR COURTS AND KEEP ACCESS FOR YOU.
02:03:37 IN MY TIME IN SAN FRANCISCO I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF
02:03:40 CIRCULATING MANY DIFFERENT CIRCLES BETWEEN TECH ART
02:03:44 AND NIGHTLIFE AND I CAN SAY THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS A LIVING
02:03:45 EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE PRIORITIZE EQUITY ACCESS,
02:03:48 COMMUNITY ATHLETICS AND NON TRANSACTIONAL STEWARTS
02:03:52 STEWARDSHIP IN A CITY THAT HAS SEEN SO MUCH CHANGE
02:03:56 AND TRANSIENTS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.
02:03:57 WHAT I FOUND ON THE TENNIS COURT WAS MAGICAL.
02:04:00 PEOPLE FROM EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD, EVERY BACKGROUND COMING
02:04:04 TOGETHER AROUND SHARED COURTS AND SHARED VALUES.
02:04:05 >> NO MEMBERSHIP FEES, NO BARRIERS JUST NEIGHBORS HELPING
02:04:09 NEIGHBORS LEARN PLAY AND BELONG.
02:04:12 >> THIS IS WHAT INCLUSIVITY LOOKS LIKE IN ACTION NOT
02:04:15 BECAUSE ANYONE MANDATED IT BUT BECAUSE FREE ACCESS NATURALLY
02:04:19 CREATES IT. >> THE COMMUNITY STEWARDSHIP
02:04:20 I'VE EXPERIENCED IS EXTRAORDINARY.
02:04:24 PEOPLE VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME SHARE EQUIPMENT, ORGANIZE
02:04:27 EVENTS ALL WITHOUT ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REQUIRED
02:04:31 . AND THIS IS CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AT
02:04:32 ITS PUREST RESIDENTS CARING FOR EACH OTHER AND OUR SHARED
02:04:36 PUBLIC SPACES FOR FREE COURTS DON'T JUST PROVIDE RECREATION
02:04:39 THEY PROVIDE CONNECTION MENTAL HEALTH AND BELONGING.
02:04:43 THEY CREATE THE THIRD SPACES OUR NEIGHBORHOODS DESPERATELY
02:04:46 NEED ESPECIALLY AS OUR CITY FACES CHALLENGES WITH ISOLATION
02:04:49 AND COMMUNITY FRAGMENTATION. >> A $5 HOURLY FEE UP TO 1001
02:04:56 70 ANNUALLY FOR REGULAR PLAYERS WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THIS
02:05:00 DYNAMIC. >> IT WOULD EXCLUDE THE VERY
02:05:03 PEOPLE WHO NEED COMMUNITY CONNECTION THE MOST.
02:05:05 >> SO WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT TENNIS COURTS.
02:05:08 WE'RE IN PUBLIC SPACES. OUR FREE MAGIC HAPPENS.
02:05:11 AUTHENTIC COMMUNITY CAN FLOURISH WHERE SAN FRANCISCO'S
02:05:15 PROMISE OF OPPORTUNITY AND BELONGING REMAINS
02:05:16 ACCESSIBLE TO ALL. >> PEOPLE SHOW UP AS THEY ARE,
02:05:20 CONTRIBUTE WHAT THEY CAN AND BUILD AUTHENTIC
02:05:23 RELATIONSHIPS WITHOUT FINANCIAL BARRIERS.
02:05:24 AND THIS IS CIVIC WELLNESS. >> IT'S BASED.
02:05:28 I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS FEE AND THANK YOU.
02:05:30 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
02:05:35 HELLO SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS JASON PRADO AND A
02:05:39 RESIDENT OF THE MISSION DISTRICT.
02:05:40 I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE MISSION ATHLETIC CLUB, A
02:05:42 VOLUNTEER TENNIS COMMUNITY THAT HAS GROWN ENTIRELY THROUGH FEE
02:05:45 FREE PUBLIC TENNIS COURT ACCESS.
02:05:46 I ALSO URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE PROPOSED $5 COURT
02:05:50 RESERVATION FEE. SINCE I STARTED PLAYING TENNIS
02:05:53 THREE YEARS AGO, THE PARKS HAVE BECOME AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
02:05:54 PART OF MY LIFE. THE COURTS ARE A PLACE I GO TO
02:05:58 SEE FRIENDS, MAKE NEW FRIENDS AND TO STAY HEALTHY.
02:05:59 WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT OUR PARKS THOUGH IS THAT FOR THE
02:06:02 COUPLE OF HOURS I'M THERE I'M NOT A CUSTOMER, I'M NOT A WAGE
02:06:06 EARNER. I'M NOT ENGAGED IN A COMMERCIAL
02:06:07 TRANSACTION. I'M THERE AS A CITIZEN AND A
02:06:09 MEMBER OF A COMMUNITY. THAT IS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE
02:06:10 THE PARK IS FREE. ONCE YOU PAY FOR SOMETHING
02:06:13 YOU'RE A CUSTOMER AGAIN. I DON'T WANT TO BE A CUSTOMER
02:06:16 EVERY MINUTE OF MY LIFE. FOR ME WHAT STARTED AS A GROUP
02:06:17 CHAT FOR SOME UNDEREMPLOYED FRIENDS TO PLAY PICK UP MATCHES
02:06:21 AFTER THE PANDEMIC HAS GROWN TO A THOUSAND MEMBERS AND A REALLY
02:06:24 BIG GROUP CHAT WHERE PEOPLE FIND COMMUNITY AND FIND A LOVE
02:06:25 FOR OUR CITY. THE MISSION ATHLETIC CLUB IS A
02:06:28 PLACE PEOPLE FIND BELONGING AND SAN FRANCISCO.
02:06:31 THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT YOUNG PEOPLE MOVE TO S.F. JUST TO
02:06:32 ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS BUT THEY SEE THE CITY AS A TRANSACTION.
02:06:35 I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY. I'VE BEEN HERE ALMOST 20 YEARS
02:06:39 AND I SEE PEOPLE ON THE TENNIS COURT GET INVESTED IN SAN
02:06:40 FRANCISCO TOO. THEY FALL IN LOVE WITH IT
02:06:43 AND THEY GIVE BACK TO IT AND THAT MATTERS.
02:06:44 I'M CERTAIN THAT IF WE HAD TO BE CUSTOMERS TO PLAY TENNIS ON
02:06:47 OUR BEAUTIFUL COURTS THAT COMMUNAL FEELING WILL DISAPPEAR
02:06:50 . THE COURSE WILL HAVE A PRICE
02:06:51 BUT MUCH LESS VALUE AND OUR COMMUNITY WILL BE POORER FOR
02:06:54 IT. PROTECT OUR COURTS.
02:06:55 PLEASE SAY NO TO THE $5 FEE. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
02:06:57 NEXT SPEAKER WELCOME. HI EVERYONE.
02:07:01 I'M PRINCE BOUCHER, A RESIDENT OF DISTRICT NINE AND FOUNDER OF
02:07:05 THE MISSION ATHLETIC CLUB. WE BELIEVE COMMUNITY ATHLETICS
02:07:08 IS A VEHICLE FOR CIVIC WELLNESS.
02:07:09 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WE HOST ABOUT 25 EVENTS A MONTH
02:07:13 ON TOP OF SEVERAL PROGRAMS AND WE ALSO HOST THAT SERVICE
02:07:17 OUR 2000 MEMBER COMMUNITY. BASICALLY MEMBERS USED TO PLAY
02:07:23 2 TO 3 TIMES A MONTH AND NOW THE PLAY TWO TIMES 2 TO 3 TIMES
02:07:25 A WEEK. ALL OF THIS IS FREE BUT FOR
02:07:27 SOME REASON THERE'S A CONSPIRACY WITHIN PD THAT WE
02:07:31 ARE A FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION. FOR THE RECORD WE ARE NOT.
02:07:34 THEY CAN ALL ATTEST TO THIS AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE
02:07:36 COMMUNITY. I'M ALSO HERE TO SAY NO TO THE
02:07:39 $5 FEE. JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE
02:07:42 HAD OVER 3000 PEOPLE WHO SIGNED A PETITION.
02:07:45 I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU GOT OUR EMAILS AS WELL.
02:07:47 AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO LEARN
02:07:52 ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AS A FREE SERVICE AND THIS IDEA OF
02:07:53 STEWARDSHIP FOR PD. I BELIEVE WE'RE DOING A LOT OF
02:07:57 THEIR WORK AND URBAN UTILIZATION, SOCIAL WELL-BEING,
02:08:01 PHYSICAL HEALTH, URBAN ACTIVATION AND ECONOMIC
02:08:04 DEVELOPMENT. THE GAME WE PLAY IT'S CALLED
02:08:08 LIVE BALL. WE BASICALLY GET 24 PEOPLE ON
02:08:10 THE COURT ON TO COURT SORRY WHICH THIS COURT UTILIZATION
02:08:14 IDEA OF THE $5 FEE WOULD HELP INCREASE THE CAPACITY.
02:08:18 WE'RE DOING THAT JOB VERY WELL. ON CERTAIN DAYS WE GET 50
02:08:22 PEOPLE ON THREE COURTS. THAT WOULD BE 22 COURTS TAKEN.
02:08:25 WE DO THAT WITH THREE COURTS. IF WE WERE ENABLED WE'D BE ABLE
02:08:29 TO DO A LOT MORE. WE'VE ONLY BEEN AROUND FOR 18
02:08:32 MONTHS AND THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S KEPT ME IN THE
02:08:37 CITY. AND THE REASON I LOVE STAYING
02:08:38 IN SAN FRANCISCO WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT WE DELIVER MORE
02:08:41 GDP THAN THIS TRIVIAL $300,000 THAT IF FEW WOULD CONTRIBUTE
02:08:47 TO. IT'S ALSO HIGHLY GROSSLY
02:08:51 STATED. AGAIN, THIS FEE WILL REDUCE THE
02:08:54 HIGH VALUE DRIVING COMMUNITY THAT'S DOING ITS PART TO
02:08:55 REVITALIZE SAN FRANCISCO. PLEASE DO NOT PASS THIS $5 FEE.
02:08:59 THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
02:09:05 MIKE SPEAKER, WELCOME. >> OH, HELLO.
02:09:09 >> I WAS BORN ON A MILITARY BASE RAISED ON MILITARY BASES
02:09:12 AND BY A PATRIOTS WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF AMERICA'S WEAPONS
02:09:13 USED TO TERRORIZE INNOCENT PEOPLE WORLDWIDE.
02:09:16 I NOW CONDEMN NATIONALISM IN AMERICA'S WAR CRIMES AGAINST
02:09:20 HUMANITY NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.
02:09:21 IN THAT VEIN, I CONDEMN AMERICA'S TERRORIZING
02:09:24 AND EXECUTION OF JONATHAN JOSS WHO IS A COMANCHE AND WHITE
02:09:28 MOUNTAIN APACHE. THIS IS A STATEMENT FROM
02:09:29 KRISTIN, HIS HUSBAND. MY HUSBAND AND I WERE INVOLVED
02:09:32 IN A SHOOTING WHILE CHECKING THE MAIL AT THE SITE OF OUR
02:09:33 FORMER HOME THAT HOME WAS BURNED DOWN AFTER OVER TWO
02:09:36 YEARS OF THREATS FROM PEOPLE IN THE AREA WHO REPEATEDLY TOLD
02:09:39 US THEY WOULD SET FIRE TO IT. WE REPORTED THESE THREATS TO
02:09:40 LAW ENFORCEMENT MULTIPLE TIMES AND NOTHING WAS DONE THROUGHOUT
02:09:43 THAT TIME. WE WERE HARASSED REGULARLY BY
02:09:45 INDIVIDUALS WHO MADE IT CLEAR THEY DID NOT ACCEPT OUR
02:09:48 RELATIONSHIP. MUCH OF THE HARASSMENT WAS
02:09:49 OPENLY HOMOPHOBIC. WHEN WE RETURNED TO THE SITES
02:09:51 TO CHECK OUR MAIL WE DISCOVERED THE SKULL OF ONE OF OUR DOGS
02:09:54 AND ITS HARNESS PLACED IN CLEAR VIEW.
02:09:55 THIS CAUSED BOTH OF US SEVERE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.
02:09:58 WE BEGAN YELLING AND CRYING IN RESPONSE TO THE PAIN OF WHAT
02:10:01 WE SAW WHILE WE WERE DOING THIS A MAN APPROACHED US.
02:10:02 HE YELLED, STARTED YELLING VIOLENCE, HOMOPHOBIC SLURS AT
02:10:05 US AND HE RAISED HIS GUN FROM HIS LAP AND FIRED JONATHAN
02:10:09 AND I HAD NO WEAPONS. WE WERE NOT THREATENING ANYONE.
02:10:11 WE WERE GRIEVING. WE WERE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE
02:10:14 WHEN THE MAN FIRED, JONATHAN PUSHED ME OUT OF THE WAY.
02:10:17 HE SAVED MY LIFE. JONATHAN IS MY HUSBAND.
02:10:18 HE GAVE ME MORE LOVE IN OUR LIFETIME OUR LIFE TOGETHER THAN
02:10:21 MOST PEOPLE EVER GETS. WE WERE NEWLYWEDS.
02:10:24 WE PICKED VALENTINE'S DAY. WE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF
02:10:26 LOOKING FOR A TRAILER AND PLANNING OUR FUTURE.
02:10:28 HE WAS MURDERED BY SOMEONE WHO COULD NOT STAND THE SIGHT OF
02:10:30 TWO MEN LOVING EACH OTHER. I WAS WITH HIM WHEN HE PASSED.
02:10:32 I TOLD HIM HOW MUCH HE WAS LOVED TO EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTED
02:10:35 HIM HIS FANS, HIS FRIENDS KNOW THAT HE VALUED YOU DEEPLY.
02:10:38 HE SAW YOU AS FAMILY AND MY FOCUS NOW IS ON PROTECTING
02:10:42 JONATHAN'S LEGACY AND HONORING THE LIFE WE BUILT TOGETHER.
02:10:45 >> IF YOUR CONCERN IS HOW SOMEONE COPED WITH TRAUMA OR
02:10:47 HOW LOUDLY THEY SPEAK WHEN RECOUNTING INJUSTICE AND BEING
02:10:50 IGNORED BY AUTHORITIES THEN YOU NEVER TRULY CARED ABOUT MY
02:10:53 HUSBAND JONATHAN SAVED MY LIFE. I WILL CARRY THAT FORWARD.
02:10:56 I WILL PROTECT WHAT HE BUILT. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
02:11:01 WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. >> HELLO SUPERVISORS.
02:11:07 MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER MAGUIRE AND I'M BORN AND RAISED HERE
02:11:11 IN THE CITY. I'M INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF
02:11:12 ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS GOING TO QUATTRO SFO, LDC AND I'M HERE
02:11:18 TO SUPPORT SUPERVISOR WALDEN'S RESOLUTION OPPOSING STATE CUTS
02:11:22 TO MEDICARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS.
02:11:25 AS A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN, I OWE MY ENTIRE LIFE TO MY
02:11:29 PARENTS WHO IMMIGRATED HERE TO THE UNITED STATES FROM HONDURAS
02:11:33 . >> THEIR HARDSHIPS AND BATTLES
02:11:33 IN NAVIGATING THIS COUNTRY HAVE SET UP A LIFE FOR ME AND MY
02:11:36 FAMILY. RIGHT NOW, HOWEVER, OUR
02:11:40 COMMUNITIES ARE BEING TARGETED FROM THE CONSTANT THREAT OF ICE
02:11:44 RATES TO NOW GUTTED FUNDS. IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE FIGHTING
02:11:47 AN UPHILL BATTLE. >> HEALTH CARE IS ALREADY SUCH
02:11:51 A COMPLEX THING TO UNDERSTAND AND THESE KINDS OF CUTS ONLY
02:11:54 CREATE MORE BARRIERS FOR OUR UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES.
02:11:58 >> AFTER SEEING THIS RESOLUTION, I AM HOPEFUL THAT
02:12:00 WE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND CREATE MORE
02:12:03 EQUITABLE DECISIONS IN POLICY. I WANT TO ONCE AGAIN SAY THANK
02:12:06 YOU TO SUPERVISOR WALTON AND THE CO-SPONSORS OF THIS
02:12:10 RESOLUTION FOR TAKING A STAND AND FIGHTING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT.
02:12:14 >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
02:12:20 >> YES, THANK YOU ALL. IT'S NICE TO TALK TO YOU ALL
02:12:24 IN ONE ROOM. THIS I THINK IS MY FIRST PUBLIC
02:12:28 COMMENT. SO GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL.
02:12:31 I ALSO WANT TO CONCUR WITH A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT SPOKE
02:12:35 ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION AS WELL AS THE $5 FEE FOR THE
02:12:39 TENNIS COURTS. I'M OBVIOUSLY A PERSON THAT
02:12:42 ADVOCATES FOR A GREAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO PROVIDES GREAT
02:12:46 SERVICES AND OBVIOUSLY TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES YOU NEED
02:12:50 FUNDS. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT
02:12:54 FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS TO HAVE ACCESSIBILITY TO THOSE
02:12:58 COURTS. >> SO I WANT TO URGE A NO VOTE
02:13:02 ON THAT. >> BUT THE REASON I WANTED TO
02:13:03 TALK TO YOU GUYS TODAY IS FOR THE NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE
02:13:07 AWARENESS MONTH OR SORRY DAY. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
02:13:11 FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT DAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW, I'M A YOUNG
02:13:18 PERSON AND A LOT OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FEARFUL OF GOING TO
02:13:23 SCHOOL OF GOING TO UNIVERSITY BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARFUL THAT
02:13:29 SOMEONE WILL COME IN WITH A GUN AND HONESTLY OUR SCHOOL SHOULD
02:13:33 NOT BE A UNIVERSITY ZONE OR SORRY, YOU KNOW, LIKE A
02:13:37 MILITARY ZONE WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE POLICE AROUND IN THE WHOLE
02:13:41 PLACE TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE.
02:13:42 AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE OUR CHILDREN GO THROUGH DRILLS
02:13:48 ,YOU KNOW. >> SO I OF COURSE SUPPORT THE
02:13:53 SECOND AMENDMENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN
02:13:54 A LOT OF THINGS ROLLED BACK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
02:13:58 RECENTLY AND REGARDING THE THE USE OF GUNS IN PUBLIC.
02:14:04 SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP FOR OUR CITY TO
02:14:08 RECOGNIZE THAT WE SUPPORT THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
02:14:12 OF COURSE THIS IS THE UNITED STATES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE
02:14:16 SUPPORT PEOPLE'S SAFETY AND PEOPLE'S OUR CHILDREN'S
02:14:19 SAFETY. SO THANK YOU SUPERVISOR CHERYL
02:14:23 FOR BRINGING THAT UP. >> ALL RIGHT.
02:14:27 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. LET'S WELCOME OUR NEXT SPEAKER
02:14:33 . >> GOOD AFTERNOON, PRESIDENT
02:14:34 MERRIMAN. BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
02:14:38 MY NAME IS MICHAEL RUPAK. I AM A DISTRICT NINE RESIDENT.
02:14:41 I'M ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS FOR LATIN X
02:14:45 DEMOCRATIC CLUB IN SAN FRANCISCO.
02:14:46 >> I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR A COURSE OF ACTION.
02:14:49 I'M HERE TO ASK THAT YOU SWIFTLY AND IMMEDIATELY PASS A
02:14:53 RESOLUTION THAT FORMALLY OPPOSES GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S
02:14:57 PROPOSED MEDICARE CUTS AND ENROLLMENT FREEZE.
02:15:01 THESE THESE CUTS WILL HURT OUR COMMUNITIES.
02:15:04 WE NEED AN AFFIRMED COMMITMENT TO TO HAVE THE SECURITY
02:15:08 AND HAVE THE LEADERSHIP IN SAN FRANCISCO PUSH BACK WHEN WE ARE
02:15:12 BEING ATTACKED FEDERALLY. AND NOW AT THE STATE LEVEL WE
02:15:17 NEED OUR CITY TO COME IN AND SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES.
02:15:20 SO PLEASE RISE TO THIS CALL OF ACTION.
02:15:23 >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. HAVE A GREAT DAY.
02:15:24 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT.
02:15:27 THIS MIGHT BE OUR LAST SPEAKER IF YOU'RE HERE TO PROVIDE
02:15:31 GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT. PLEASE STEP UP TO THE LINE
02:15:34 OTHERWISE THIS WILL BE OUR LAST SPEAKER.
02:15:35 WELCOME, SIR. MY NAME IS RICHARD RUSTY
02:15:38 PETERSON AND I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS
02:15:45 AND PARTICULARLY COMMUNICATIONS WITH SOME OF OUR MOST NOTABLE
02:15:50 CITIZENS SUCH AS SIR JONATHAN IVES.
02:15:54 I NOTICED IN A RECENT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WHICH I I'M SURE YOU
02:16:02 HAVE ALL SEEN I GUESS DOES THAT SHOW UP OR DO I HAVE TO SLIDE
02:16:07 IT SOMEWHERE? >> YES, WE CAN SEE IT.
02:16:12 WELL I'M SURE I'M SURE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS LEFT
02:16:16 IN THIS ROOM AS I READ IT. BUT IN ANY EVENT, THE OPEN
02:16:20 AND TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATIONS WITH SIR JONATHAN IVE AND OTHER
02:16:24 NOTABLES CITIZENS SUCH AS MARC BENIOFF IS REALLY AN ALLUSION.
02:16:32 >> AND IF YOU TRY AND MAKE A DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THEM
02:16:35 THEY DUCK AND DODGE. I ONLY BRING THIS UP BECAUSE
02:16:39 IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN'T REALLY TRUST THESE LARGE COMPANIES.
02:16:43 I'VE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
02:16:48 LITIGATION FOR 20 YEARS OH MAYBE 50 YEARS NOW I'M GETTING
02:16:51 OLD AND I REALLY THINK THAT THE NEXT THING THAT IS COMING DOWN
02:16:58 THAT YOU MUST BE YOU AS A BOARD MUST BE REALLY CAREFUL OF IS A
02:17:02 PUSH FOR PARCEL TAXES THAT GO BEYOND THE LITTLE PARCEL TAX
02:17:10 THAT WE NOW SUFFER ON RESIDENCES BECAUSE MANY OF
02:17:18 THESE CORPORATIONS ARE LARGE ON A SINGLE PARCEL.
02:17:22 AND THAT IS THE EASIEST WAY TO STEAL THE TAXPAYERS MONEY.
02:17:26 OAKLAND IS DOING IT IN GREAT SHAPE WITH MANY DIFFERENT ONES
02:17:33 . >> SO I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING
02:17:34 ME TO SPEAK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
