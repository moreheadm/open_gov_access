00:27:15 MADAM Clerk, can you please
00:27:16 call our next item?
00:27:19 >> item 14 was referred without
00:27:20 recommendation from the budget
00:27:21 and finance committee.
00:27:23 It's a resolution to approve
00:27:23 the sixth amendment sixth
00:27:24 amendment to a grant agreement
00:27:27 between the office of economic

00:27:42 new total of approximately 69.8
00:27:45 million excuse me that is 68.8
00:27:48 million through JUNE 30th 2025.
00:27:52 >> chair chan thank you present
00:27:53 amendment colleagues and I rise
00:27:56 to speak to why this item was
00:27:56 forwarded out of committee
00:27:59 without recommendation.
00:28:00 I think many of you already
00:28:04 know that in the past that to
00:28:07 up to date the city is still
00:28:10 facing a looming budget deficit
00:28:11 of $1 billion layer on top of
00:28:14 that even a greater challenge
00:28:15 that in a prior fiscal year
00:28:18 with now we have the trump
00:28:18 administration injecting
00:28:22 greater chaos and uncertainty
00:28:22 into our state and local
00:28:23 budgets.
00:28:28 We already spent more than $68
00:28:29 million on this contract since
00:28:32 2018 without clear result and
00:28:35 matrix for success.
00:28:36 And now for this fiscal year
00:28:38 alone with this amendment
00:28:39 additional $4 million we will
00:28:43 have spent about $25 million
00:28:46 in this fiscal year just for
00:28:47 this contract alone.
00:28:50 In this one year I want to give
00:28:53 you sort of a context of what
00:28:53 that means.
00:28:57 >> the same $25 million is also
00:28:57 approximately the same amount
00:29:01 that that mayor breed has held
00:29:04 up for this very same fiscal
00:29:05 year.
00:29:08 And these including funding for
00:29:09 dental care and health care at
00:29:12 our public school sites.
00:29:13 And in fact supervisor souder
00:29:16 has a resolution for us to vote
00:29:17 on later today is to make sure
00:29:20 that we have celebrate and
00:29:21 recognize children.
00:29:24 Dental health care day or in.
00:29:28 And so with that also the very
00:29:28 same $25 million our
00:29:29 transitional age youth
00:29:32 outpatient rates and behavioral
00:29:33 health support workforce
00:29:35 development women and victim
00:29:36 services tenants counseling
00:29:39 services, rental subsidies,
00:29:43 violence interventions services
00:29:46 and a 24 hour pit stop program
00:29:47 which you know that in the
00:29:47 mission and many other
00:29:50 neighborhoods really, really
00:29:50 need.
00:29:53 So knowing that there are a lot
00:29:54 of people and services are
00:29:57 competing for the very same $25
00:29:57 million that this contract
00:30:00 represents, I want to
00:30:01 articulate why I will be voting
00:30:04 against this contract amendment
00:30:04 today.
00:30:08 How do we deliver equity or
00:30:11 equitable city services in this
00:30:12 coming year is is something
00:30:16 that we need to start talking
00:30:19 about right now not until JUNE
00:30:20 .
00:30:20 >> we should know that a dollar
00:30:24 is a dollar a dollar spent on
00:30:24 one thing is a dollar missing
00:30:27 for another city services that
00:30:28 we now have to identify another
00:30:32 dollar or worse that we now
00:30:32 have to cut and reduce.
00:30:36 I wish we're not where we're at
00:30:39 today that I can actually say
00:30:40 let's move forward with all the
00:30:42 dollars that we needed to
00:30:43 support everything that need
00:30:47 our support when it comes to
00:30:47 city services and
00:30:48 neighborhoods.
00:30:51 But it is one of those moments
00:30:51 that we have to face the
00:30:55 financial reality I leave to
00:30:59 you colleagues I am not here to
00:31:00 urging you to support or
00:31:03 against this contract.
00:31:04 I am here to simply remind you
00:31:07 as your budget committee chair
00:31:07 that when we spend this money
00:31:11 it's actually being taking out
00:31:12 from somewhere else.
00:31:14 It's a tradeoff conversation
00:31:15 that we must make and but today
00:31:19 I am going to be voting against
00:31:21 this very $4 million additional
00:31:24 $4 million for this contract
00:31:25 being aware that it's coming
00:31:28 from somewhere else including
00:31:29 the list I just provided to
00:31:29 you.
00:31:32 Thank you.
00:31:32 >> thank you.
00:31:35 Chair and supervisor mahmud.
00:31:36 >> colleagues, I'd like to
00:31:36 speak out in support of this
00:31:39 item which is requesting an
00:31:40 increase of grant funding for
00:31:43 community based safety programs
00:31:44 to JUNE 30th, 20 25.
00:31:47 >> I think all of us can agree
00:31:48 it would be an understatement
00:31:48 to say these programs have been
00:31:50 critical for the neighborhoods
00:31:51 in district five especially
00:31:54 in the tenderloin as well as
00:31:55 in district six and so and so
00:31:58 MAY as well if you walked into
00:31:59 work today and walked through
00:32:01 U.N. Plaza or grabbed a coffee
00:32:02 at phil's and golden gate, you
00:32:03 were likely greeted with a warm
00:32:06 good morning and have a lovely
00:32:07 rest of your day by someone
00:32:10 smiling in a vest whose work is
00:32:10 funded by this grant.
00:32:13 These kind words that brighten
00:32:14 your morning are just a small
00:32:17 part of the work done by
00:32:18 community ambassadors who do so
00:32:18 much of the important work our
00:32:22 city departments cannot do.
00:32:23 And I have heard repeatedly
00:32:25 from S.F. Pd that this is work
00:32:26 that they cannot do.
00:32:28 >> these are men and women who
00:32:29 were once incarcerated but have
00:32:30 been given a second chance at
00:32:34 life, a second chance at being
00:32:34 part of our community and who
00:32:37 possess a unique life
00:32:38 experience which allows them to
00:32:38 connect with others who are
00:32:41 struggling in our streets from
00:32:42 addiction, homelessness, mental
00:32:44 health issues or a combination
00:32:45 of the three.
00:32:47 These ambassador programs at
00:32:48 this money will fund where
00:32:49 deployed have been shown to
00:32:52 reduce crime in areas by as
00:32:56 much as 52% and drug crimes by
00:32:56 80%.
00:32:57 As a tenderloin resident I know
00:33:00 I appreciate seeing them in my
00:33:01 neighborhood and but I've heard
00:33:03 from neighbors who reached out
00:33:03 on this particular item
00:33:04 extremely concerned about what
00:33:07 might happen next if they were
00:33:07 cut because community
00:33:10 ambassadors have become just
00:33:11 that a part of our community.
00:33:14 I've heard from S.F. Pd and dpw
00:33:15 how instrumental these
00:33:18 community ambassadors are for
00:33:18 complimenting their work, not
00:33:19 replacing it to keep our
00:33:22 streets safe and clean.
00:33:25 At the same time I hear my
00:33:26 colleague's concerns about the
00:33:27 need to review contracting for
00:33:30 accountability and for change.
00:33:30 And I'm looking forward to
00:33:31 going through that process
00:33:33 during this budget cycle.
00:33:34 But we need to make sure that
00:33:36 any replacement or anything
00:33:37 that happens is done in a way
00:33:38 that doesn't result in an
00:33:41 immediate reduction of service
00:33:41 that would have disastrous
00:33:44 effects for the neighborhoods
00:33:45 that have seen that double
00:33:46 digit reduction in crime and
00:33:46 drug dealing where these
00:33:49 ambassadors are placed in the
00:33:50 interim this program is driving
00:33:53 positive results and if we are
00:33:53 to make changes we need to do
00:33:56 it in a regulated fashion that
00:33:57 we have something to replace
00:33:57 over time.
00:33:58 >> but overall these are
00:34:00 positive results for our
00:34:01 residents that you simply
00:34:05 cannot put a price on community
00:34:05 massive programs like those
00:34:06 funded in mid-market and
00:34:09 tenderloin make our streets
00:34:09 safer for families and children
00:34:13 who live here and for those on
00:34:13 transit commuting to work and
00:34:14 for those visiting us from far
00:34:16 away to take in to our great
00:34:17 city.
00:34:18 So I urge my colleagues to vote
00:34:22 in support of this item.
00:34:23 Thank you.
00:34:23 Supervisor mahmud.
00:34:26 MADAM Clerk, could you please
00:34:27 call the roll on this item on
00:34:27 item 14.

00:35:03 >> all right without objection
00:35:07 this resolution is adopted.
00:35:07 >> MADAM Clerk, could you
00:35:11 please call item 15?
00:35:12 >> item 15 this is an ordinance
00:35:14 to amend the planning code to
00:35:15 exempt certain types of
00:35:18 projects in the downtown area
00:35:19 that replace nonresidential
00:35:21 uses with residential uses from
00:35:22 development impact fees and
00:35:25 requirements to include the
00:35:26 inclusionary housing fee.
00:35:28 Remove the application deadline
00:35:29 from the commercial to
00:35:30 residential adaptive reuse
00:35:33 program and to require periodic
00:35:34 reporting to the inclusionary
00:35:37 housing technical advisory
00:35:37 committee to affirm the second
00:35:38 determination and to make the
00:35:41 appropriate findings.
00:35:42 >> all right.
00:35:45 Supervisor dorsey thank you
00:35:46 PRESIDENT Melbourne.
00:35:47 Colleagues, I am pleased to be
00:35:49 among those bringing this item
00:35:50 to you today together with
00:35:52 mayor laurie and supervisor
00:35:53 sartor.
00:35:53 Amendments were circulated
00:35:54 earlier I believe you have them
00:35:57 before you and I am happy to
00:35:58 support them.
00:36:00 I represent communities in the
00:36:01 east cut in mission bay that
00:36:01 are really blueprints for what
00:36:04 a vibrant mixed vice because.
00:36:05 >> can you hold on a second?
00:36:08 Could we lower signs I guess
00:36:11 are all right but the request
00:36:12 is that they be lowered so that
00:36:13 you're not blocking the view of
00:36:15 the people behind you.
00:36:16 >> there's a board rule that
00:36:19 indicates they should not be
00:36:20 blocking view and be
00:36:23 essentially in your lap.
00:36:24 >> so there we go.
00:36:24 Okay.
00:36:25 All right.
00:36:27 Take it away, supervisor.
00:36:28 >> thanks, PRESIDENT Mandolin.
00:36:28 Thank you.
00:36:28 Audience.
00:36:30 I represent communities like
00:36:31 the east cut in mission bay
00:36:34 that are really blueprints for
00:36:35 what a vibrant mix of uses can
00:36:37 mean to fulfill the promise of
00:36:37 21st century urbanism
00:36:38 underutilized and vacant office
00:36:41 buildings offer us an
00:36:42 incredible opportunity to
00:36:43 unlock more units of housing
00:36:45 and to welcome new neighbors
00:36:45 downtown.
00:36:46 In many ways this legislation
00:36:49 seeks to correct the errors of
00:36:53 20th century planning which was
00:36:53 overreliant on office only
00:36:56 downtowns and which isn't
00:36:57 serving our city well today.
00:36:57 Office to residential projects
00:37:00 not only contribute to our
00:37:01 housing goals, they also reduce
00:37:04 the supply of vacant offices
00:37:05 which helps to stabilize the
00:37:05 office market and by extension
00:37:08 our property and business tax
00:37:09 base that supports everything
00:37:09 our city does.
00:37:12 However, we are not currently
00:37:13 seeing these projects move
00:37:16 forward at the scale or the
00:37:16 pace we need.
00:37:17 This ordinance would help to
00:37:19 lower those costs by waiving
00:37:20 impact fees including
00:37:21 inclusionary housing
00:37:24 requirements for targeted and
00:37:24 narrow set of downtown office
00:37:27 to housing conversion projects
00:37:28 in the c-3 and c-2 zoning
00:37:31 districts and I believe it is a
00:37:32 reasonable tradeoff to make
00:37:33 when we are currently not
00:37:35 getting the impact fee revenue
00:37:36 or inclusionary units from all
00:37:39 these projects that aren't
00:37:40 getting built because of high
00:37:40 costs.
00:37:41 This ordinance is about
00:37:43 stimulating housing development
00:37:44 in downtown.
00:37:47 Both these conversion projects
00:37:48 and new housing projects
00:37:48 downtown and citywide.
00:37:51 And with that I want to thank
00:37:52 all the staff of the office of
00:37:52 office of economic and
00:37:55 workforce development for their
00:37:56 work on this the mayor's office
00:37:58 and of course our land use
00:37:59 chair supervisor melgar.
00:38:00 thanks also to supervisor chen
00:38:03 for your engagement and
00:38:04 questions throughout this
00:38:04 process.
00:38:06 I'm looking forward to passing
00:38:07 this today and I hope to have
00:38:10 your support.
00:38:11 >> supervisor chan thank you
00:38:14 PRESIDENT Randleman.
00:38:17 I also want to thank supervisor
00:38:18 chen for her work and trying to
00:38:21 figure this out in in and
00:38:25 really to look at this not just
00:38:26 for a short term growth but
00:38:29 really the long term impact
00:38:30 when you waive any type of
00:38:35 impact fees and in this case
00:38:39 the inclusionary impact fees
00:38:40 for any type of development and
00:38:43 project.
00:38:46 I would again put my hat on
00:38:47 when we think about the future
00:38:47 of our city, when we think
00:38:50 about budget.
00:38:50 Thinking about where do we
00:38:51 contain you'll be able to
00:38:53 identify funding to build
00:38:54 affordable housing.
00:38:54 >> those are real challenges
00:38:57 that we have to face.
00:38:58 And while I do understand that
00:39:01 you know, creating a waiver
00:39:02 which we have done about many
00:39:05 things for small business, we
00:39:06 typically didn't do these type
00:39:09 of for exemptions and waivers
00:39:12 with a sunset date because with
00:39:16 the understanding that you know
00:39:17 ,once we do something a waiver
00:39:20 to be able to enact a fee or
00:39:23 enact a tax measure or increase
00:39:24 certain fees, it will be it
00:39:27 will be tremendously
00:39:30 challenging for the board to
00:39:31 take on.
00:39:34 >> and so principally I am
00:39:35 against fee waiver especially
00:39:39 those without some kind of a
00:39:42 sunset date or some kind of
00:39:43 condition and cap.
00:39:46 >> so I just want to thank the
00:39:46 mayor and thank supervisor
00:39:49 dorsey and thank supervisor
00:39:50 souder for coming really to the
00:39:54 table and to say yes, let's
00:39:54 figure out ways to boost long
00:39:57 term growth to boost the growth
00:40:01 of a space that really need
00:40:02 that growth for housing and
00:40:02 meeting that demands.
00:40:05 But thank you supervisor chen
00:40:06 for really thinking about then
00:40:09 what do we do to also make sure
00:40:10 that it doesn't create a long
00:40:13 term fiscal burden for the city
00:40:16 that we now end up losing money
00:40:17 for building more affordable
00:40:20 affordable housing and
00:40:21 inclusionary housing on site.
00:40:25 >> so with that I am today
00:40:28 in support of you've amended
00:40:31 and successfully we capping
00:40:34 this to a $7 million
00:40:35 7,000,000ft2 which I calculated
00:40:38 roughly probably about 7000
00:40:39 units of two bedrooms of
00:40:43 housing.
00:40:43 My assumption I don't know but
00:40:46 that's my assumption of that
00:40:47 and perhaps then that makes
00:40:51 sense for our area that not
00:40:52 only need the grove but the
00:40:55 city that actually needs it to
00:40:56 meet the demands of housing
00:40:56 elements.
00:40:59 >> so thank you supervisors for
00:41:00 working on this.
00:41:02 >> I do want to two centers if
00:41:03 I MAY thought through our
00:41:07 PRESIDENT And man domain to the
00:41:07 land use committee at this
00:41:11 moment that I do hope that this
00:41:11 conversation can be really
00:41:14 discussed in the committee as
00:41:18 PRESIDENT Mendo men have talked
00:41:21 about last last week you know
00:41:22 regarding another legislation I
00:41:23 think that some of these can
00:41:25 actually provide a longer
00:41:29 conversation and allow some of
00:41:29 these conversation to take
00:41:30 place.
00:41:33 >> it's not just because where
00:41:33 the committee is is is
00:41:37 delegated to do so but also the
00:41:38 stand will allow public
00:41:38 comment.
00:41:40 >> it will allow public
00:41:41 comments, allow the community
00:41:44 to have feedback about the
00:41:45 legislation and whether this is
00:41:48 something that we can learn
00:41:48 more about and perhaps there
00:41:49 are more things that can be
00:41:49 done.
00:41:52 So not just really an
00:41:55 afterthought of of adding to
00:41:58 today's and to the land use
00:41:59 committee and thank you so much
00:42:00 again to the land use committee
00:42:03 for your work but I truly hope
00:42:04 that we can actually have this
00:42:06 conversation took place in the
00:42:07 committee level allowing
00:42:08 community feedback instead of
00:42:10 full bore with that thank you.
00:42:11 >> thank you chair chan
00:42:14 supervisor sauder thank you
00:42:15 chair.
00:42:17 >> I first want to thank mayor
00:42:18 lori and supervisor dorsey for
00:42:20 their partnership on this
00:42:21 important piece of legislation
00:42:24 that will bring more housing
00:42:25 downtown and make use of our
00:42:29 city's excess vacant office
00:42:29 spaces.
00:42:30 Thank you to to chair melgar
00:42:32 for helping move this
00:42:33 legislation forward and land
00:42:33 use committee and of course to
00:42:36 supervisor chen for working
00:42:37 with us to craft today's
00:42:40 amendments in the committee we
00:42:43 added language to refer this
00:42:44 waiver to the inclusionary
00:42:45 technical advisory committee
00:42:47 tac as part of the feasibility
00:42:50 review that occurs every three
00:42:50 years.
00:42:51 in discussions with supervisor
00:42:53 chen we have agreed to go
00:42:54 further to add a clear boundary
00:42:54 on this program.
00:42:58 I'm glad we could come to this
00:42:58 compromise that responds to the
00:43:02 concerns raised by many
00:43:02 community organizations about
00:43:05 making this waiver indefinite.
00:43:06 So today I am introducing an
00:43:09 amendment to place a 7,000,000
00:43:09 square foot cap on the total
00:43:12 square footage subject to this
00:43:13 development fee waiver
00:43:15 in addition to two small
00:43:16 technical amendments that
00:43:17 accommodate the cap in the
00:43:19 legislation.
00:43:20 The reason being is by setting
00:43:23 a cap on square footage we
00:43:23 ensure that we do not
00:43:24 prematurely short circuit these
00:43:27 conversions at an arbitrary
00:43:28 date since we of course do not
00:43:29 know what the economy will look
00:43:31 like in the years ahead.
00:43:32 Instead the square footage cap
00:43:35 translates to about 7000
00:43:35 converted units.
00:43:39 That is roughly half of the
00:43:40 high end estimate made by
00:43:42 spurned agent gensler.
00:43:43 Of the number of converted
00:43:44 units that downtown could
00:43:46 currently accommodate.
00:43:46 So we're setting the stage for
00:43:49 this program to get us halfway
00:43:50 there and if and when it is
00:43:51 successful we can bring it back
00:43:54 to the board to revisit as
00:43:54 needed.
00:43:55 A copy of these amendments were
00:43:58 circulated before today's
00:43:58 meetings and have been passed
00:43:59 out as a hard copy for your
00:44:01 review with the amendments
00:44:02 highlighted in yellow.
00:44:05 This is a forward thinking
00:44:06 policy that will help us
00:44:06 revitalize downtown while
00:44:09 ensuring our city meets its
00:44:09 long term housing needs.
00:44:13 And I want to just pause to
00:44:13 remind us of the context that
00:44:17 we're doing this within a 35%
00:44:17 downtown office vacancy.
00:44:21 Many of those that we want to
00:44:22 return to office use but many
00:44:24 that we know in the 510 years
00:44:27 ahead will not have that office
00:44:28 demand and we need to think
00:44:31 creatively, creatively to make
00:44:32 sure that these can be homes
00:44:32 for residents.
00:44:35 We are behind other cities
00:44:36 in this effort far behind
00:44:40 in fact, new york city has 8310
00:44:43 units underway for office to
00:44:44 residential conversion at the
00:44:44 moment.
00:44:46 And it's not just our large
00:44:50 metros cincinnati 1753 units
00:44:53 cleveland 1690 and pittsburgh
00:44:53 1250.
00:44:57 San francisco does not make the
00:44:58 list of the top 20 cities that
00:45:01 have these conversions.
00:45:01 And with your support I think
00:45:02 we can get on that list.
00:45:05 Most importantly, we can work
00:45:06 to accelerate our downtown
00:45:09 recovery and accommodate new
00:45:09 homes for residents.
00:45:10 >> thank you.
00:45:13 Thank you.
00:45:13 >> supervisor sauder,
00:45:16 supervisor walton thank you and
00:45:17 thank you PRESIDENT Amendment
00:45:19 and I just want to start my
00:45:20 statements by saying I'm
00:45:23 completely all for these
00:45:24 conversions but I do think that
00:45:27 we are setting a trend here.
00:45:28 We've been fighting extremely
00:45:31 hard to be responsible about
00:45:35 development and at the same
00:45:36 time meet housing goals in this
00:45:36 city.
00:45:39 We have certain communities
00:45:40 that are suffering from
00:45:43 indigenous population flight
00:45:44 and on the brink of complete
00:45:47 extinction which goes even
00:45:51 beyond gentrification priority
00:45:51 equity neighborhoods such as
00:45:54 south of market and of course
00:45:55 bayview and district ten are to
00:45:59 be protected and growth must be
00:45:59 responsible and these
00:46:02 communities are critical to
00:46:03 true districts are in place for
00:46:06 a specific reason and that is
00:46:07 to protect these communities
00:46:10 from complete annihilation.
00:46:10 The rhetoric is that we need
00:46:13 housing all over san francisco
00:46:17 and that MAY be true but the
00:46:18 practice is we do not build all
00:46:21 over san francisco except
00:46:22 in neighborhoods with less
00:46:25 voice and most disenfranchize
00:46:26 us and in most cases that is to
00:46:30 be true and by the way we build
00:46:33 in district ten so this is not
00:46:36 someone who is against building
00:46:37 and against growth.
00:46:39 The original agreed upon sunset
00:46:40 date for inclusionary decreases
00:46:44 and fee waivers protects
00:46:44 affordable housing and aligns
00:46:47 with the goal to make san
00:46:51 francisco more affordable.
00:46:51 >> I know that there are people
00:46:55 who want san francisco to be
00:46:55 completely devoid of black
00:46:58 people and they don't want to
00:46:59 see a decrease in the wealth
00:47:02 gap but to blatantly disregard
00:47:06 community voice is ridiculous
00:47:07 and indicative of guaranteeing
00:47:10 that the democratic process is
00:47:11 almost nonexistent here in san
00:47:15 francisco we are on the brink
00:47:18 of setting some horrible trends
00:47:19 in this city and I hope that at
00:47:23 some point we start to listen
00:47:27 to community voice particularly
00:47:28 when it comes to growth and
00:47:31 building housing.
00:47:32 This coming from the supervisor
00:47:35 who actually builds housing.
00:47:38 >> thank you, MR. PRESIDENT.
00:47:39 >> thank you.
00:47:42 Supervisor walton our clerk has
00:47:46 reminded me that there is a
00:47:47 motion that has been made by
00:47:50 supervisor sauder and I should
00:47:51 ask if there's a second for
00:47:53 that seconded by melgar.
00:47:54 >> thank you.
00:47:54 Supervisor melgar supervisor
00:48:01 fielder thank you, PRESIDENT.
00:48:02 I first want to thank
00:48:02 supervisor chen and the 33
00:48:05 community organizations
00:48:06 including our culture districts
00:48:09 that appealed to mary leary and
00:48:09 my colleagues to amend the
00:48:12 legislation that was originally
00:48:13 introduced by the former mayor
00:48:13 that would exempt
00:48:16 nonresidential two residential
00:48:17 conversions from any
00:48:17 inclusionary housing
00:48:20 requirements affordable housing
00:48:23 fees and childcare fees.
00:48:24 >> the proposed legislation
00:48:27 will eliminate impact fees for
00:48:28 projects that convert office
00:48:31 space to housing in the soma
00:48:32 tenderloin, chinatown, north
00:48:32 beach and surrounding
00:48:35 neighborhoods during a time
00:48:36 when we absolutely need more
00:48:39 affordable housing the projects
00:48:40 that this legislation will
00:48:44 incentivize will be market rate
00:48:47 with no one side affordable
00:48:49 housing and will provide zero
00:48:49 funding for affordable housing
00:48:52 impact fees, zero funding for
00:48:53 child care impact fees that
00:48:56 goes towards child care
00:48:56 facilities.
00:48:57 >> the impetus for this
00:49:00 legislation doesn't emerge from
00:49:01 vacuum or even from the recent
00:49:03 past.
00:49:04 There is a long tragic history
00:49:07 upon which this legislation
00:49:10 builds and tries to solve for
00:49:14 between the 50s, late 40s and
00:49:15 the 70s the san francisco
00:49:18 redevelopment agency as we know
00:49:19 ,demolished 14,000 housing
00:49:21 units in san francisco
00:49:22 including in these priority
00:49:26 equity geographies under the
00:49:27 auspices of slum removal.
00:49:30 >> this involved a complete
00:49:30 overhaul of soma.
00:49:34 >> it was in this time that our
00:49:35 S.F. Development redevelopment
00:49:38 agency director justin herman
00:49:38 said about soma this land is
00:49:41 too valuable to permit poor
00:49:42 people to park on it.
00:49:46 >> since then massive actions
00:49:46 followed the demolition of
00:49:47 thousands of housing units a
00:49:49 district court ruled in favor
00:49:50 of those poor and working class
00:49:53 tenants and a substantial
00:49:54 portion of the area has been
00:49:57 transformed into office and
00:49:57 convention space.
00:49:58 >> which brings us to our
00:50:01 present predicament of not just
00:50:05 an oversupply of office space
00:50:05 and a deep need for affordable
00:50:09 housing but also a budget
00:50:09 precariously tied to the ever
00:50:13 unpredictable booms and busts
00:50:13 of the exact downtown the city
00:50:16 created when it cleared human
00:50:17 beings and destroyed housing to
00:50:20 make way for big business.
00:50:21 And so with my vote I am
00:50:21 acknowledging that we need
00:50:24 housing in this area much more
00:50:24 than we need office space.
00:50:27 And I'm also warning that we
00:50:28 need affordable housing much
00:50:31 more than we need empty homes.
00:50:32 Thank you supervisor field or
00:50:35 supervisor chen thank you
00:50:38 PRESIDENT Colleagues over the
00:50:39 last few days I have worked
00:50:42 very hard to find common
00:50:43 grounds on this legislation.
00:50:44 >> I want to appreciate the
00:50:47 mayor's office for creating
00:50:47 space to meet with our
00:50:51 community leaders and also here
00:50:51 are their concerns throughout
00:50:54 this process the north star has
00:50:55 been now too we support our
00:50:58 downtown recovery.
00:50:59 >> why also ensuring a just
00:51:02 recovery for the working class
00:51:03 community in the downtown
00:51:06 in the downtown area.
00:51:06 I have urge our mayor's office
00:51:10 to ensure that cultural and
00:51:11 working class community share
00:51:14 that in this in the prosperity
00:51:14 and have a seat at the table.
00:51:17 The amendments proposed it
00:51:18 in this legislation by
00:51:21 supervisor salter establish a
00:51:22 limit to the number of
00:51:23 conversion of office buildings
00:51:25 to residential that are exempt
00:51:28 from community impact fee to
00:51:29 fund childcare, open space,
00:51:33 affordable housing, transit
00:51:33 schools and other community
00:51:36 infrastructures.
00:51:37 >> this legislation does as a
00:51:38 working class community to make
00:51:40 a sacrifice in the service of
00:51:44 our downtown recovery efforts.
00:51:45 I have worked with the mayor's
00:51:46 office to urge them to really
00:51:49 see our working class community
00:51:49 in this in our city wide
00:51:52 recovery and also our budget
00:51:53 investments and that we also
00:51:56 prioritize the needs of our
00:51:59 children seniors, working class
00:52:00 families and our most
00:52:01 vulnerable.
00:52:03 >> the 33 organization that
00:52:04 advocates throughout this
00:52:07 process have made a very strong
00:52:08 case that they have uplifted
00:52:11 the community needs and
00:52:12 solutions that pointed to the
00:52:15 need for added protection to
00:52:18 our priority equity geographies
00:52:19 and our cultural district.
00:52:19 For example the transgender
00:52:23 district, the soma filipinas
00:52:23 cultural district that lines
00:52:26 and within the scope of this
00:52:26 legislation these are
00:52:29 geographies that have borne the
00:52:34 burden of displacement not only
00:52:34 in the past but in the present
00:52:35 day.
00:52:38 I really hope that we would be
00:52:38 able to leave out this
00:52:41 community in the scope of this
00:52:45 legislation and when the market
00:52:45 kicks in and more office to
00:52:49 residential conversion occur,
00:52:49 we are ensuring that affordable
00:52:52 housing investment and impact
00:52:53 fees continue to flow to these
00:52:54 communities.
00:52:57 >> I am disappointed that we
00:52:58 couldn't go further to achieve
00:53:01 this carve out but however I
00:53:02 also want to say that is this
00:53:05 is only a month and three weeks
00:53:06 in file mayor's office and I
00:53:09 have heard repeatedly that and
00:53:10 we also have heard repeatedly
00:53:13 from our mayor that it is a new
00:53:14 day.
00:53:15 >> we are still finding ways to
00:53:18 work collaboratively with our
00:53:18 mayor's office and with each
00:53:21 other.
00:53:22 >> now it's the time for a more
00:53:24 comprehensive and proactive
00:53:25 planning that include community
00:53:29 and all impacted stakeholders.
00:53:30 The mayor's office has informed
00:53:30 me that they are willing to
00:53:33 continue to meet with our
00:53:34 community leaders to discuss
00:53:37 strategies to advance
00:53:37 affordable housing and
00:53:40 community stabilization goals
00:53:41 and I am putting a lot of trust
00:53:44 in the mayor's office and I'm
00:53:45 hoping that we can continue to
00:53:46 learn from this experience and
00:53:48 continue to build strong
00:53:49 partnership together if we are
00:53:53 taking away then we must find a
00:53:55 way to replenish the resources
00:53:56 that we're at for our working
00:53:57 class community that is needed
00:54:00 and deserve.
00:54:00 Thank you to all the
00:54:03 neighborhood leaders you all
00:54:04 have done a beautiful job of
00:54:05 educating our members of the
00:54:08 board and stepping forward to
00:54:08 represent the needs of our
00:54:11 community of your communities.
00:54:12 And again I want to thank the
00:54:15 mayor's office for hearing our
00:54:16 community and committed to work
00:54:19 towards solutions and thank
00:54:19 you.
00:54:23 And I also will vote today to
00:54:23 support supervisor salter's
00:54:26 amendment and the legislation.

00:58:18 generations.
00:58:19 Today I am proud to recognize
00:58:23 cedric spencer, a distinguished
00:58:23 leader and advocate whose work
00:58:26 bridges the corporate,
00:58:27 legislative and community
00:58:30 spheres to drive meaningful
00:58:31 change.
00:58:31 And MR. Spencer, could you come
00:58:40 stand up at the podium please?
00:58:44 >> as vice PRESIDENT Of
00:58:45 relations at paramount, cedric
00:58:48 has dedicated his career to
00:58:49 advancing policies that shape
00:58:52 the entertainment industry and
00:58:52 beyond.
00:58:56 With 25 years of experience
00:58:57 working to improve legislative
00:58:58 outcomes for community and
00:59:01 corporate relations, his impact
00:59:04 is both broad and profound.
00:59:05 But beyond his professional
00:59:08 achievements, cedric's passion
00:59:09 lies in fostering equity,
00:59:09 ensuring that education and
00:59:13 innovation thrive in spaces
00:59:14 that have historically been
00:59:16 underserved.
00:59:17 Cedric's commitment to service
00:59:20 is reflected in his leadership
00:59:21 roles across numerous
00:59:24 organizations including his
00:59:25 board presidency at young
00:59:28 community developers leading
00:59:31 their growth through a major
00:59:32 pandemic.
00:59:33 His stewardship as treasurer of
00:59:35 the california state university
00:59:40 alumni council and his advocacy
00:59:41 as vice chair of the american
00:59:43 network for action.
00:59:44 His contributions to the naacp
00:59:48 california hawaii state
00:59:48 conference further underscore
00:59:52 his dedication to justice and
00:59:52 empowerment.
00:59:56 Cedric spencer is not only a
00:59:57 leader he is a bridge builder,
01:00:00 a visionary and an inspiration
01:00:01 to those who strive to create a
01:00:03 better future.
01:00:04 >> on a personal note, I would
01:00:07 like to add that I learned so
01:00:11 much from cedric about how to
01:00:11 become an elected official.
01:00:14 he not only mentored me
01:00:15 in fraternal roles and
01:00:18 positions but laid the
01:00:18 foundation and taught me what
01:00:19 was needed to successfully get
01:00:22 elected.
01:00:23 He helped me flesh out my
01:00:26 values, set an example and gave
01:00:27 me examples of how to be
01:00:30 strategic and keep the true
01:00:30 essence of yourself.
01:00:34 Importantly he taught me that
01:00:35 to be in a leadership role
01:00:38 requires you to set and live by
01:00:38 a certain example.
01:00:42 As we honor him today, I want
01:00:45 to make sure that he knows and
01:00:45 everyone knows how important it
01:00:49 is to have examples of
01:00:49 leadership that stay true to
01:00:50 their values.
01:00:53 On behalf of district ten here
01:00:56 in the chamber I extend my
01:00:57 deepest gratitude for his
01:01:00 unwavering dedication and
01:01:00 tireless efforts.
01:01:04 His work reminds us all of the
01:01:07 power of advocacy collaboration
01:01:18 and the courage to dream boldly
01:01:18 .

01:03:09 black people allowed to buy a
01:03:15 home in the outer sunset.
01:03:18 Yes.
01:03:19 >> yes, it is true.
01:03:23 For many decades nonwhite
01:03:23 people were not allowed to be
01:03:24 homeowners throughout much of
01:03:27 san francisco's west side.
01:03:28 Baseball hero willie mays tried
01:03:31 to buy a house on the west side
01:03:35 in 1957 and was denied three
01:03:35 years later in 1960, dorothy
01:03:39 and her husband arthur were
01:03:41 able to buy their home on 48th
01:03:41 avenue.

01:04:11 purchase of her outer sunset
01:04:12 home and she made history again
01:04:15 with her job.
01:04:17 She had to fight to become the
01:04:18 first black teacher at an inner
01:04:22 sunset elementary school until
01:04:22 dorothy came along.
01:04:23 Black teachers were only
01:04:26 assigned to majority black
01:04:27 schools and dorothy would
01:04:29 eventually become a school
01:04:39 principal and dorothy served
01:04:40 our city in many other ways.
01:04:43 >> she was appointed by mayor
01:04:43 dianne feinstein to serve.
01:04:47 Yes, she was appointed by mayor
01:04:48 feinstein to serve on the
01:04:48 commission on the status of
01:04:51 women.
01:04:52 She also joined mayor
01:04:52 feinstein's delegation to
01:04:55 abidjan when it was named a
01:04:56 sister city to san francisco.
01:04:59 And dorothy was a founding
01:05:00 member of the museum of the
01:05:02 african diaspora and she served
01:05:03 on its board of directors.
01:05:09 >> all right.
01:05:13 >> daughter was born
01:05:13 in arkansas and attended
01:05:14 lincoln university in missouri
01:05:17 where she met and married art
01:05:17 lathan.
01:05:20 Art joined the army which moved
01:05:21 the couple to san francisco and
01:05:22 art was sent to korea and
01:05:24 dorothy stayed in san
01:05:25 francisco.
01:05:26 Now when art returned they left
01:05:29 their rental in hunters point
01:05:29 and found the house they could
01:05:30 afford and the outer sunset
01:05:33 next to the ocean.
01:05:33 And they raised three kids
01:05:34 in that house.
01:05:37 Sadly, art passed away in 2022
01:05:40 after 69 years of marriage.
01:05:40 They had a joyous partnership.
01:05:43 They danced every day and they
01:05:47 traveled to every continent.
01:05:50 >> yes, including antarctica.
01:05:54 and today dorothy enjoys time
01:05:55 with her grandchildren and
01:05:58 great grandchildren.
01:05:59 She is loved by her neighbors.
01:05:59 Dorothy has many lessons to
01:06:02 teach us.
01:06:03 I love her zest for life and
01:06:05 her forward looking
01:06:06 perspective.
01:06:06 Despite having to endure many
01:06:09 challenges in the past.
01:06:10 Now here is one scene that sums
01:06:13 up dorothy at one of our recent
01:06:14 night markets in the sunset.
01:06:18 I saw dorothy with a cane
01:06:18 in one hand and a margarita
01:06:22 in the other hand and she was
01:06:25 bopping to the music, right?
01:06:25 Yes, she was.
01:06:31 So thank you, dorothy.
01:06:31 >> thank you, dorothy, for
01:06:32 being such an inspiration for
01:06:35 san francisco.
01:06:36 >> and now let's hear from you.

01:06:40 going to kill an old woman with
01:06:42 all this joy.

01:06:43 me.
01:06:46 It's just unbelievable.
01:06:50 I have been on cloud nine ever
01:06:51 since I heard that this honor

01:07:11 I'm glad this day has come and
01:07:14 I'm glad this day is going to
01:07:15 end.
01:07:15 >> it's just been too much
01:07:18 excitement for an old woman.
01:07:19 >> but what I'd like to do is
01:07:22 give a tribute to my husband.
01:07:25 >> my husband made me aware of
01:07:26 the value of feel at the
01:07:29 therapy and service.
01:07:34 And we have had so many
01:07:34 interesting functions that
01:07:37 we've performed in the city
01:07:41 that have brought us so many
01:07:41 rewards and so many friends.
01:07:45 >> and I'm just so happy to be
01:07:45 able to say that I have a room
01:07:48 full of friends back here with

01:09:31 I'd like to call mike carter
01:09:34 and the gas field services team
01:09:41 from virginia up front.
01:09:45 We should cfl board members and
01:09:45 audience.
01:09:48 We've all heard the news of
01:09:49 devastating wildfires that
01:09:52 broke out and threatened los
01:09:52 angeles last month becoming
01:09:56 some of the most destructive
01:09:57 in our state's history.
01:09:57 And our thoughts are with those
01:10:00 who are dealing still with that
01:10:01 an unimaginable loss in a
01:10:04 situation where many were
01:10:04 fleeing.
01:10:08 Amidst that crisis there were
01:10:09 51 brave workers from the gas
01:10:12 and fleet members of pge and
01:10:13 from the bay area who
01:10:16 volunteered to go towards the
01:10:16 fire to help our neighbors
01:10:17 in southern california.
01:10:20 >> and jan, these gas and
01:10:20 electric crews went to support

01:10:35 blackhawk helicopters to assist
01:10:36 cal fire in aerial firefighting
01:10:39 to help contain the flames.
01:10:40 Providing this mutual
01:10:43 assistance is a hallmark that
01:10:44 we should be celebrating.
01:10:47 And my partner and his team
01:10:48 want to would love to command

01:10:55 team.
01:10:56 I'd like to commend their
01:10:56 bravery, hard work and
01:10:59 dedicated service to others
01:10:59 you've demonstrated in your
01:11:02 courageous mutual assistance
01:11:02 work.
01:11:03 Your actions have restored a
01:11:06 sense of normalcy for many
01:11:06 going through some of their
01:11:07 worst times.
01:11:10 And we are proud of your work

01:11:25 recognizing honoring the pge
01:11:27 employees that went down to
01:11:28 L.A. To support the restoration
01:11:28 effort.
01:11:29 Second, I would definitely like
01:11:31 to recognize people from the
01:11:32 bay area that came from san
01:11:32 francisco and peninsula area
01:11:34 specifically to go out there
01:11:35 and support for over a few
01:11:36 weeks to make sure that we were
01:11:38 able to provide the customers

01:12:38 recognize a man whose
01:12:40 dedication has left an
01:12:41 indelible mark on six district
01:12:42 six neighborhoods I represent
01:12:46 in san francisco citywide.
01:12:47 We today celebrate someone
01:12:49 whose leadership and service
01:12:50 have transformed our streets,
01:12:53 uplifted our neighborhoods and
01:12:53 restored community pride.

01:13:00 the soho community benefit
01:13:07 district and step up for with
01:13:08 with more than a decade of
01:13:11 experience managing community
01:13:11 benefit districts.
01:13:12 Christian has worked tirelessly
01:13:14 to make west soma streets and
01:13:15 sidewalks cleaner, safer and
01:13:18 more welcoming.
01:13:19 His leadership in launching the
01:13:21 summer west cbd in MARCH 2020
01:13:22 was a defining moment
01:13:25 establishing the operational
01:13:26 and financial structures needed
01:13:29 to support businesses,
01:13:29 residents and visitors.
01:13:30 We know the challenges facing
01:13:33 san francisco streets public
01:13:34 drug use, graffiti, illegal
01:13:37 dumping and myriad safety
01:13:37 concerns.
01:13:40 these are complex but christian
01:13:41 has never shied away from them.
01:13:42 He has met each challenge with
01:13:44 innovation, collaboration and
01:13:45 an unwavering commitment to
01:13:45 progress.
01:13:48 Under his leadership somewhere
01:13:51 cbd has become a driving force
01:13:52 in street cleaning, public
01:13:53 safety and community
01:13:53 engagement.
01:13:56 His work is evident
01:13:57 in thousands of pounds of trash
01:13:59 removed in countless graffiti
01:14:02 abatement tags.
01:14:03 In proactive and compassionate
01:14:04 outreach to unhoused
01:14:06 individuals.
01:14:07 But christian's impact goes far
01:14:10 beyond cleaning up the streets
01:14:10 .
01:14:11 He has improved city response
01:14:14 times integrated technology
01:14:15 into service delivery and
01:14:16 championed policies that
01:14:18 strengthen our urban
01:14:19 infrastructure and contribute
01:14:22 to a high quality public realm
01:14:22 .
01:14:23 His leadership was instrumental
01:14:24 in expanding the city's
01:14:26 connected worker app pilot,
01:14:27 allowing real time referrals
01:14:30 for cleaning and maintenance
01:14:31 requests, setting a new
01:14:31 standard for managing public
01:14:34 spaces.
01:14:34 Christians dedication extends
01:14:38 beyond soma west as the leader
01:14:38 of the ocean avenue
01:14:39 association, he is ensuring yet
01:14:42 another part of our city
01:14:42 benefits from his leadership.
01:14:43 His service on the board of the
01:14:46 episcopal community services of
01:14:46 san francisco too reflects his
01:14:49 deep commitment to addressing
01:14:50 the root causes of poverty and
01:14:53 homelessness.
01:14:54 This kind of selfless long term
01:14:56 dedication is rare.
01:14:57 It is the kind of leadership
01:14:58 that inspires action, builds
01:15:01 trust and fosters true
01:15:01 progress.
01:15:02 The kind of leadership our city
01:15:05 needs.
01:15:06 Christian's work is isn't
01:15:08 always easy nor is it always
01:15:09 glamorous.
01:15:09 But it is really necessary.
01:15:12 It is impactful.
01:15:13 It is transformative.
01:15:14 So christian, on behalf of my
01:15:17 own neighbors and district six
01:15:17 residents I represent business
01:15:20 owners advocates who have
01:15:21 benefited from your tireless
01:15:21 work and leadership.

01:19:02 was going through some
01:19:03 leadership difficulties.
01:19:06 >> we have an organization that
01:19:10 had been around for a while.
01:19:11 People were not believing
01:19:11 in the mission.
01:19:14 Things were a little bit tired
01:19:14 and with a collaboration and
01:19:18 long coordination with chris

01:21:19 finding an executive director
01:21:23 for that was a tall order for
01:21:23 the community and they found
01:21:26 what I believe to be one of the
01:21:27 best in the country not only
01:21:28 the city but the country.
01:21:30 This is somebody who is a
01:21:31 strategic thinker thinks
01:21:34 outside of the box and you
01:21:34 heard it from other folks who
01:21:38 say it much more eloquently
01:21:38 than I.
01:21:39 His empathy knows no bounds
01:21:42 during the pandemic he opened
01:21:43 up the soma west cbd to help
01:21:47 other cbd with their pandemic
01:21:47 response.

01:26:07 team.
01:26:08 >> former supervisor jairo
01:26:11 sandoval from district 11 once
01:26:14 quipped that michael jordan
01:26:15 owes his place as the greatest
01:26:16 pro basketball player
01:26:18 in history only because reb g
01:26:22 decided to choose ministry
01:26:23 rather than basketball
01:26:23 professionally.
01:26:27 >> reggie completed his master
01:26:29 of divinity degree in 1983 and
01:26:30 was ordained as ingleside
01:26:34 presbyterian church's full time
01:26:34 pastor.
01:26:38 After that and he's been there
01:26:39 ever since seeing the church's
01:26:42 immense potential.
01:26:43 >> reggie organized the
01:26:43 ingleside church basketball
01:26:46 league inside the church's
01:26:49 gymnasium providing a positive
01:26:50 space for local youth to learn

01:27:02 potential and moreover to

01:27:06 leaders and mentors.
01:27:07 And a few of them are right
01:27:09 here today and many of them are
01:27:13 not here because they are busy
01:27:14 at the church or running the
01:27:14 afterschool program.
01:27:17 Reggie positioned his church as
01:27:18 a nexus for the ocean.
01:27:21 >> richard ingleside community

01:27:56 is a celebration of black

01:29:09 community.
01:29:12 I am forever grateful to reggie
01:29:12 for his compassion and his

01:34:03 and thank you and and I believe
01:34:04 the supervisor melgar has some
01:34:06 additional I just wanted to add
01:34:07 one more thing and that is that
01:34:10 in addition to the resolution
01:34:11 that we will be passing today
01:34:14 on your birthday and the
01:34:15 commendation to you, our mayor
01:34:19 daniel lurie was kind enough to
01:34:19 also provide our recognition
01:34:23 for you as well which I will be
01:34:23 handing over after your award.
01:34:26 So if you could come up reb g
01:34:27 and say a few words that would
01:34:37 be great.
01:34:38 >> but first I'd like to give
01:34:41 honor to GOD for my beautiful
01:34:45 mother and I have to mention
01:34:48 her MRS. Shirley lee wilson
01:34:52 gordon before I knew the hyde
01:34:53 pa I knew my mother and I know
01:35:00 that I receive in life I owe it
01:35:03 to my mother and then I met
01:35:07 jesus and it was understood why
01:35:11 the mother was so beautiful and
01:35:12 so I went on to her now praise
01:35:15 like GOD and I'm thankful for
01:35:15 that.
01:35:18 I love children and dedicated
01:35:21 my journey especially to young
01:35:22 american boys.
01:35:26 Many who don't think they're
01:35:26 anything think that our race
01:35:29 has done nothing.
01:35:30 I was inspired to put muhammad
01:35:33 ali on the wall when I arrived
01:35:39 at ingleside in 1978.
01:35:40 i don't know what city been
01:35:43 in crises at that time and the
01:35:48 late mayor died and fine shine
01:35:49 helped me out senior citizen it
01:35:51 wouldn't even go to the
01:35:51 bathrooms.
01:35:54 The building was so dilapidated
01:35:57 I was first refused help
01:35:58 in that area and then I think
01:36:01 it was MRS. Johnson he came out
01:36:05 and he said you got it right
01:36:07 back to the mayor and they they
01:36:08 came through for us and
01:36:11 improved the bathrooms.
01:36:15 So in 1906 and many don't know
01:36:18 the history of ingleside that
01:36:18 ingleside the people in the
01:36:21 neighborhood began to formulate
01:36:22 the ministry as a result of
01:36:26 earthquake of 1906 1907 they
01:36:30 were doing various bible study
01:36:31 groups and stuff for people
01:36:33 though they hated it help those
01:36:37 living in tents at the
01:36:38 racetrack and out in ingleside
01:36:41 and and 1917 formalized
01:36:45 everything when I saw that
01:36:46 history of service of people
01:36:48 service to GOD through service
01:36:51 humanity became our thing
01:36:52 because we inherited serving
01:36:52 people.
01:36:56 That's the bottom line and
01:37:00 especially the young boys I
01:37:01 noticed the boys on ali and put
01:37:04 another picture up.
01:37:05 I had no idea all that these
01:37:09 years later that I could fill
01:37:10 up a whole gym in most of the
01:37:12 church and they thought I was
01:37:12 crazy.
01:37:15 But just as I was called to
01:37:16 preach the gospel I was called
01:37:19 to do that wall been I'll be
01:37:20 gone into glory but that wall
01:37:23 would still have value and
01:37:24 inspire young people of all
01:37:27 races and all people to that
01:37:30 you get to give GOD his dues
01:37:31 and no matter who you are as a
01:37:34 human being we all are the
01:37:34 same.
01:37:34 We all have the same
01:37:35 opportunities.
01:37:39 We're not all of the same here
01:37:40 but you got to make your way.
01:37:40 >> it's the bottom line you
01:37:41 can't give up on anything when
01:37:45 you got GOD on your side.
01:37:46 >> I want to put this short
01:37:49 because I want to I want to say
01:37:50 this that we really feel moved
01:37:51 to say this that this city was
01:37:53 named after saint francis of
01:37:54 assisi and you heard nelda
01:37:56 miller talk about what she
01:37:57 looks at every day.
01:38:00 I want to take the time to
01:38:00 honor saint francis.
01:38:03 What I do is I have their
01:38:04 parents have children to rehab.
01:38:07 They some as they have a child
01:38:08 to read this first thing and
01:38:10 every morning lasting every
01:38:11 night because the children are
01:38:15 being program for violence just
01:38:16 by being born in this world and
01:38:20 saint francis asked GOD to make
01:38:20 him an instant of peace and I
01:38:23 was inspired to to take those
01:38:24 words and make it into an
01:38:26 affirmation which says I am an
01:38:30 instrument of peace where
01:38:31 there's hatred I shall promote
01:38:34 love.
01:38:35 Well there's injury.
01:38:35 Pardon?
01:38:38 Well there's doubt faith where
01:38:41 there's despair, hope where

01:39:12 pardoned and I've had parents
01:39:16 to tell me to teach their

01:39:20 thinking.

01:45:55 builds pathways for
01:45:55 historically excluded

01:46:00 ensure that black voices are
01:46:03 heard in all aspects of theater
01:46:05 from performance to leadership

01:46:11 unique talent.
01:46:13 Today one of his productions
01:46:14 this year the day the sky
01:46:17 turned orange is a time capsule
01:46:17 of san francisco from the
01:46:21 middle of the pandemic a time
01:46:21 when the end of the world
01:46:25 seemed to be coming into view.
01:46:25 >> in dark times we turned to
01:46:28 the arts to calm our fears and
01:46:29 stave off despair.
01:46:32 When the going gets tough we
01:46:33 rely on artists and creators
01:46:33 like rodney to help get us
01:46:36 through.
01:46:36 >> we thank you rodney.

01:46:58 truly a young living legend.
01:46:59 >> if you want to be proud of
01:47:02 something in san francisco

01:47:05 >> there is not another person
01:47:06 in san francisco in arguably
01:47:10 the world that is more talented
01:47:11 and more altruistic than this
01:47:11 young person.
01:47:15 So thank you so much supervisor
01:47:15 malcolm and PRESIDENT Malcolm
01:47:17 for acknowledging me.
01:47:20 Thank you.
01:47:20 >> wow.
01:47:24 Thank you all so much.
01:47:25 I feel like I'm standing on the
01:47:26 shoulders of all the company of
01:47:28 people I was honored with.
01:47:28 It's incredible.
01:47:32 I'm only 34 years old, born and
01:47:32 raised in this city.
01:47:33 But thank you all so much for
01:47:35 this honor.
01:47:36 I stand on the shoulders of
01:47:37 those who came before me the
01:47:39 activists, the storyteller
01:47:40 leaders, community builders,
01:47:41 artistic leaders who made space
01:47:43 for voices like mine my voice
01:47:47 of a young poor kid growing up
01:47:47 in the fillmore with big dreams
01:47:50 to sing, dance and act and
01:47:51 wound up somehow on broadway
01:47:54 running a theater company
01:47:55 in our city a city that has
01:47:58 always promoted originality and
01:47:58 challenge the status quo isn't
01:48:02 just about producing shows.
01:48:02 It's about creating space for
01:48:05 people to feel seen and to be
01:48:06 valued amplifying untold
01:48:09 stories and ensuring the next
01:48:10 generation of bipoc and born
01:48:13 and raised san francisco
01:48:14 artists know they have a home
01:48:17 through S.F. Baca we walk the
01:48:18 walk supporting hundreds of
01:48:22 local artists developing new
01:48:23 work that reflects our diverse
01:48:25 communities and bringing people
01:48:29 together to understand the
01:48:30 things that make us different
01:48:33 while finding commonality.
01:48:34 We need that so much in america
01:48:36 right now and in san francisco
01:48:37 .
01:48:38 >> this is how we revive and
01:48:41 reimagine our city.
01:48:42 This is how we keep san

01:48:54 in the arts in our people and
01:48:57 making S.F. A place where
01:48:58 everyone can flourish.
01:49:01 >> and I look forward to being
01:49:04 called upon by this body as a
01:49:05 voice for artists and for
01:49:08 nonprofit organizations because
01:49:09 art isn't just entertainment
01:49:09 y'all.
01:49:12 I mean it's entertaining but
01:49:15 it's what gives san francisco
01:49:16 its incredible soul.
01:49:20 And lastly we had said barco we
01:49:20 would not have been able to
01:49:23 grow nor make the huge impact
01:49:26 we have over the past four
01:49:26 years without the dream keepers
01:49:30 initiative.

01:51:02 file to the full board of

01:51:08 hearing and appropriate

01:53:26 >> thank you so much.
01:53:27 >> please continue.
01:53:27 Thank you.
01:53:30 PRESIDENT Mandel men,
01:53:34 supervisors board staff,
01:53:35 members of the public and thank
01:53:38 you again PRESIDENT Mandell man
01:53:39 as I struggle with this
01:53:41 microphone for allowing me time
01:53:48 to speak I appreciate that late
01:53:49 one evening when I was about
01:53:50 seven years old I was abruptly
01:53:53 woken up in the middle of the
01:53:56 night I woke to the rustle of
01:53:57 the covers being yanked off of
01:53:58 me and my mother's voice
01:54:00 snapping at me to get up.
01:54:03 She disappeared into the next
01:54:04 room and I heard the muffled
01:54:07 sounds of adults arguing at the
01:54:08 time she was renting a room
01:54:09 from a family in concord,
01:54:11 california.
01:54:12 I blinked an almost like magic
01:54:15 she had whisked my younger
01:54:16 sister and I into the back of a
01:54:19 car and we were off driving to
01:54:19 an unknown destination on
01:54:23 desolate streets on a cold
01:54:27 cloudless night after nearly an
01:54:28 hour we parked outside of what
01:54:29 I would now recognize as a
01:54:31 crack house.
01:54:32 My mother told us she would be
01:54:35 right back and disappeared
01:54:36 inside leaving my younger
01:54:39 sister and I in the car.
01:54:43 I don't know exactly when it
01:54:44 happened but at a certain point
01:54:48 the mix of disagree and
01:54:48 tension, panic fright and the
01:54:52 sheer discomfort of being
01:54:52 in the cold car and our thin
01:54:55 cotton pajamas bubbled over and
01:54:59 I remember seeing tears flood
01:55:00 my little sister's eyes and
01:55:03 pour down her face and I
01:55:06 remember thinking that I
01:55:07 couldn't cry because I had to
01:55:11 be strong for her after what
01:55:15 seemed like forever, my mother
01:55:16 finally emerged from the house
01:55:18 and drove us home as the sun
01:55:22 was coming up.
01:55:22 Experiences like these and
01:55:25 others like it have made me
01:55:26 realize how incredibly lucky
01:55:29 I've been because they
01:55:30 highlight how my life could
01:55:31 have ended up so differently.
01:55:33 If so many things hadn't broken
01:55:37 just my way including having a
01:55:38 father who raised my sister and
01:55:40 I all by himself with so much
01:55:43 love.
01:55:44 This instilled in me an
01:55:47 enormous drive to make
01:55:47 something of myself so as to
01:55:51 not let this luck go to waste.
01:55:52 And it also gave rise to a deep
01:55:55 sense of obligation to help
01:55:56 others who had been less lucky
01:55:58 than me.
01:56:02 So when the opportunity arose
01:56:03 to join the police commission
01:56:06 and serve my hometown the city
01:56:09 that I love I couldn't say no.
01:56:13 I threw myself into this job.
01:56:14 I approached it with a care
01:56:17 devotion and seriousness that
01:56:21 it requires from the start I
01:56:22 was also acutely aware that
01:56:25 police commissioners occupy a
01:56:25 special place in san
01:56:29 francisco's system of.
01:56:29 Over 20 years ago the people
01:56:33 amended the city's charter to
01:56:33 take power away from the mayor
01:56:37 and make police commissioners
01:56:37 independent from the political
01:56:40 branches.
01:56:41 In my three years on this
01:56:43 commission I've taken the
01:56:44 responsibility to be
01:56:47 independent very seriously.
01:56:48 I have cast every vote knowing
01:56:50 that my first and only
01:56:51 obligation is to the people of
01:56:54 san francisco not to any
01:56:58 politician or political cause.
01:56:59 >> that means that when S.F. Pd
01:57:03 engaged in unlawful, unethical
01:57:06 and unlawful conduct I asked
01:57:07 the hard questions that needed
01:57:07 to be asked.
01:57:10 The questions that the public
01:57:14 deserved answers to.
01:57:15 That's what I did when it came
01:57:16 to light that S.F. Pd was using
01:57:18 rape victim dna to investigate
01:57:21 the victims of sexual assault
01:57:22 rather than the suspects and
01:57:25 also secretly storing the dna
01:57:25 of innocent people for
01:57:26 indefinite periods.
01:57:29 That's what I did when S.F. Pd
01:57:30 purchased drones without
01:57:33 seeking board approval
01:57:33 in violation of state law.
01:57:37 That is what I did when S.F. Pd
01:57:38 gave away millions of taxpayer
01:57:41 dollars to be spent on luxury
01:57:44 vacations and gift boxes.
01:57:45 These efforts to hold S.F. Pd
01:57:47 accountable have not endeared
01:57:48 me to the leadership of our
01:57:51 police department.
01:57:52 A lot of politicians don't like
01:57:55 it either.
01:57:56 They told me that that's just
01:57:59 not how things are done in this
01:57:59 city.
01:58:03 >> but my job is not to become
01:58:03 popular with the agency I'm
01:58:06 supposed to be overseeing.
01:58:07 It is to serve the public and
01:58:09 protect and defend the rule of
01:58:16 law.
01:58:17 >> mayor lurie never bothered
01:58:20 to meet with me and he hasn't
01:58:21 bothered to justify why he is
01:58:24 removing me.
01:58:24 But he apparently has a
01:58:27 different vision of the police
01:58:28 commission than the one set out
01:58:29 in the charter.
01:58:32 He would prefer commissioners
01:58:33 who follow orders and do as
01:58:33 they're told.
01:58:36 >> he's not alone in this view
01:58:37 dismantling independent
01:58:40 oversight agencies in the name
01:58:44 of efficiency is certainly
01:58:44 in vogue these days.
01:58:47 I'm sure many in washington
01:58:48 would applaud daniel lurie's
01:58:48 course political desire for
01:58:51 more executive power.
01:58:55 But I know that san francisco
01:58:56 stands for something different
01:58:56 and I imagine many of you do
01:59:02 too when the people amended the
01:59:03 charter 20 years ago they
01:59:07 envisioned that mayors would
01:59:08 want to exert undue control
01:59:11 over the commission
01:59:11 in precisely the way that mayor
01:59:14 lurie is attempting to do now.
01:59:15 And one thing they did to
01:59:16 prevent that was to force
01:59:19 mayors to get approval from the
01:59:19 board before they could remove
01:59:22 any commissioner today this
01:59:22 board will have a chance to
01:59:26 live up to this legal
01:59:27 obligation to exercise its
01:59:30 independent judgment about
01:59:30 whether I deserve to finish my
01:59:31 term or not.
01:59:34 >> but how you vote today will
01:59:37 have much broader implications
01:59:37 in this one removal effort it
01:59:41 will reveal whether the board
01:59:41 is willing to defend the
01:59:42 public's right to honest and
01:59:45 independent oversight of the
01:59:46 police department or whether it
01:59:48 will succumb to the mayor's
01:59:49 relentless political pressure
01:59:53 and shirk this obligation a
01:59:54 failure to stand up to daniel
01:59:57 lurie's unprecedented power
01:59:58 grab will call into question
02:00:01 the independence of every
02:00:02 charter commission and I fear
02:00:06 inflexibility writing harm on
02:00:06 our institutions and our system
02:00:09 of.
02:00:12 I would like to address head on
02:00:13 a comment made by one
02:00:14 supervisor who said that my
02:00:17 failure to resign showed that I
02:00:20 was not classy in his words.
02:00:24 Let let me be clear there is
02:00:24 nothing classy about quitting
02:00:28 there is nothing classy about
02:00:29 abandoning my commitment to the
02:00:32 people of san francisco to
02:00:32 serve out my term with
02:00:36 integrity and independence and
02:00:36 there is nothing classy about
02:00:39 bending the knee to a mayor who
02:00:40 would rather have a rubber
02:00:40 stamp in my place.
02:00:44 >> yeah, I will continue to
02:00:44 fight for an independent police
02:00:47 commission free from undue
02:00:48 political influence and I hope
02:00:51 that you will too.
02:00:52 Finally, everything I've done
02:00:56 on this commission is for my
02:00:59 son everett with the hope that
02:01:03 one day he might grow up in a
02:01:07 better, safer and freer san
02:01:07 francisco.
02:01:08 >> there's been so many times
02:01:11 on this commission where I've
02:01:12 had to make a choice between
02:01:14 doing what is easy and doing
02:01:15 what is right.
02:01:15 I've made every choice with the
02:01:19 hope that one day when everett
02:01:19 is old enough to understand he
02:01:22 might be proud of me.
02:01:23 >> appearing before this board
02:01:25 today to advocate for the
02:01:26 public's right to independent
02:01:30 citizen oversight wasn't the
02:01:30 easiest choice I could have
02:01:31 made.
02:01:33 But it is the right thing to do
02:01:34 .
02:01:35 My hope is that you will all do
02:01:38 what you feel is right today.
02:01:38 >> yeah.
02:01:45 Thank you PRESIDENT Mandolin.

02:05:19 ticket a parking ticket out of
02:05:19 my own pocket.
02:05:22 So power to the people.
02:05:23 >> thank you, MR. CHAIRMAN.
02:05:24 Thank you for your comments.
02:05:26 Welcome to the next speaker,
02:05:27 MR. Washington okay.
02:05:31 >> so listen, supervisors I
02:05:33 guess is going to be more your
02:05:37 first big decisions here again
02:05:37 .
02:05:38 So our current mayor he was
02:05:38 just in the fillmore and you
02:05:41 did a tour up and down fillmore
02:05:42 got a chance to meet him.
02:05:44 He seems like a pretty
02:05:45 reasonable guy.
02:05:45 He's the mayor.
02:05:48 He's a millionaire or he's
02:05:49 here.
02:05:50 >> but the way people was
02:05:53 talking back there comparing
02:05:53 him to a trump type of
02:05:56 administration now the police
02:05:57 department I was I'm known for
02:06:00 going to the police department
02:06:00 commissioners for years.
02:06:03 I never met this commissioner
02:06:04 but he seems like a people's
02:06:08 person and I'm not clear
02:06:08 understanding why the mayor
02:06:11 wants to remove this jim and it
02:06:14 must be some politics behind
02:06:15 the politics are full of
02:06:15 tricks.
02:06:18 Makes you turn to a lunatic but
02:06:19 I don't know what's going on.
02:06:20 But the mayor I wish you would
02:06:23 consider is you're removing
02:06:26 because you got so much support
02:06:26 for this gentleman here.
02:06:29 It seems like we team you up
02:06:30 against trump and I know you're
02:06:34 not a trump sister but you a
02:06:34 millionaire.
02:06:35 But I do believe you have
02:06:38 passion in your heart so I
02:06:38 would suggest that you
02:06:42 recommend and suggest that you
02:06:43 repass this and just turn it
02:06:46 back over to him and let the
02:06:47 man stay in his position.
02:06:50 I think he's doing a wonderful
02:06:50 job now I haven't been to the
02:06:54 police commissioners so far but
02:06:57 I do know when they set the
02:06:57 this new PRESIDENT For some of
02:07:01 the police department 20 years
02:07:02 ago, that's when I was going to
02:07:05 the police commissioners often
02:07:06 so I got to visit it.
02:07:09 But I'm here supporting the
02:07:09 young man.
02:07:10 He seems to be an upright
02:07:13 person to me so mayor, you
02:07:14 better check yourself before
02:07:17 you be by yourself.
02:07:17 >> thank you, MR. Washington.
02:07:18 All right.
02:07:21 Welcome, MISS Brown.
02:07:24 >> I like to u the overhead.
02:07:27 I'm here in support of max
02:07:27 carter always.

02:07:31 He has made a resolution for to
02:07:36 show that unsolved homicides

02:07:43 child to murder and I've been

02:07:47 wednesday I've been there
02:07:47 longer and some of them that
02:07:51 have come come and go come and
02:07:52 go but none none of them have
02:07:54 never done what max carter has
02:07:55 done.
02:07:58 You see this resolution for two
02:08:01 paid tipsters to to come forth
02:08:05 for four homicides, cold cases
02:08:05 who has never no one has never
02:08:09 done this and I commend him and
02:08:12 I'm really sad that that
02:08:13 they're going to get rid of
02:08:13 them.
02:08:14 >> look at these unsolved
02:08:16 homicides.
02:08:17 >> tell me how many mothers are
02:08:19 going to are going to be happy
02:08:20 when our cases get solved.
02:08:21 >> look at them.

02:08:27 homicides, all of them look at
02:08:27 them.
02:08:31 Look at what I have to deal
02:08:35 with MARCH quarter over stone
02:08:36 has given me some some hope
02:08:40 hope this is what they left me
02:08:43 of my son.
02:08:44 Look at all the unsolved
02:08:47 homicides so you can put the
02:08:47 camera back on me.

02:09:03 children.
02:09:06 I've been around you and I seen
02:09:10 you seem to be a nice mayor.
02:09:11 Please give this young man a
02:09:13 chance.

02:09:17 there's no misconduct from him.
02:09:20 >> so please give him another
02:09:21 chance.
02:09:24 >> as a mother I need people
02:09:24 like him.

02:09:29 supervisors my district, my

02:10:11 barry, district ten citizen.
02:10:15 First I want to thank you max.
02:10:16 Thank you for all your hard
02:10:20 work in I hope after today you
02:10:23 will be continue in the hard
02:10:23 work.
02:10:24 >> I apply for the police
02:10:27 commission twice.
02:10:28 >> I never was so happy that I
02:10:31 never got a position in my life
02:10:35 because now that I see after
02:10:36 the years of watching work MR.
02:10:39 I don't want to put your name
02:10:40 but just say max all the work
02:10:42 he's done in the work that
02:10:43 those folks had to do without
02:10:46 getting paid.
02:10:47 >> I didn't have the capacity
02:10:50 at that time to do all that
02:10:51 hard work and we ought to be
02:10:54 grateful.
02:10:55 >> I say I wasn't going to come
02:10:58 down here in a while after the
02:11:01 land use committee kicked the
02:11:02 black asian community in the
02:11:09 face on the safe way issue then
02:11:13 I'm watching this mayor and he
02:11:17 hasn't did a formal meeting
02:11:17 with the black fillmore
02:11:18 alliance.
02:11:21 He hasn't done a formal meeting
02:11:21 with the black employee.
02:11:24 I don't want to say their title
02:11:25 wrong but that's two three
02:11:28 times in a row where it's like
02:11:28 forget black and brown people.
02:11:32 But now I'm here because a vote
02:11:36 to remove someone at a hearing
02:11:39 and there's no reason why where
02:11:39 is the suits?
02:11:43 >> that's usually sit at a
02:11:44 hearing to present evidence of
02:11:44 why you should vote a certain
02:11:47 way.
02:11:48 Where is that information?
02:11:49 I've been waiting on it but I
02:11:51 do not see it.
02:11:55 >> so for anybody who needs the
02:11:55 cozy up to the mayor and vote
02:11:58 his way so you can get a deal
02:11:59 or walk in a video I'll take
02:12:02 talk with him or in your future
02:12:03 endeavors to climb the ladder
02:12:06 so you need that billionaire
02:12:09 money we see you.
02:12:13 >> we see you.
02:12:19 >> thank you.
02:12:19 Gloria berry, welcome to the
02:12:19 next speaker.
02:12:21 >> I really don't think that I
02:12:21 need that much announcement but
02:12:22 I'm retired captain yolanda
02:12:25 williams, the PRESIDENT For a
02:12:26 long time of the officers for
02:12:29 justice and you know that I was
02:12:32 a victim of tax gate.
02:12:33 >> the racist text messages
02:12:37 sent by police officers.
02:12:40 The motivation behind the un
02:12:41 warranted removal of
02:12:41 commissioner carter.
02:12:44 >> oprah stone is becoming
02:12:44 increasingly clear to me.
02:12:48 >> it appears that this action
02:12:49 is intended to consolidate the
02:12:51 support within the commission
02:12:55 to eventually remove chief
02:12:56 william scott and to facilitate
02:12:59 the appointment of chief of
02:12:59 public safety.
02:13:03 >> paul yep.
02:13:04 San francisco has had enough of
02:13:06 the backdoor dealings and the
02:13:07 pay to play politics.
02:13:10 >> are we striving for a new
02:13:11 era in our city?
02:13:11 Unfortunately this situation
02:13:14 reflects the same old patterns
02:13:18 discussions MAY behind closed
02:13:19 doors while the public is left
02:13:22 with the mere facade.
02:13:23 Consider the legacy you wish to
02:13:23 leave behind.
02:13:26 Do you want to be associated
02:13:30 with such trump like divisive
02:13:30 tactics?
02:13:31 Or do you want to be part of
02:13:35 the new S.F. Trump collector's
02:13:38 club you set?
02:13:39 This was going to be a new san
02:13:43 francisco mayor daniel laurie
02:13:44 even ray charles could see
02:13:47 through this if he was alive.
02:13:48 >> thank you for your attention
02:13:50 to this troubling passing
02:13:54 pressing issue during black
02:13:54 history month.
02:13:55 >> oh and by the way, there is
02:13:57 no other acceptable black
02:14:02 american to replace over stone.
02:14:06 And while you are doing all of
02:14:06 this during black history
02:14:07 month, I want you to know this
02:14:10 is my 69 years of living and I
02:14:13 am born also in FEBRUARY.
02:14:14 This is the most shameful black
02:14:18 history month in 2025 that I
02:14:18 have ever ever witnessed.
02:14:21 And san francisco.
02:14:22 You should be ashamed of
02:14:22 yourself.
02:14:25 Shame on you.
02:14:28 Thank you for your comments.
02:14:29 >> welcome to the next speaker.
02:14:30 Good afternoon.
02:14:32 My name is rosario cervantes
02:14:33 and I'm a concerned citizen
02:14:35 that lives in district 11.
02:14:39 >> I believe I'm going to thank
02:14:39 max carter ulverstone for his
02:14:40 work.
02:14:43 >> he's he is really
02:14:43 conscientious.
02:14:44 He has integrity.
02:14:44 He's a lawyer.
02:14:47 I mean he knows the practices.
02:14:48 He we need him here.
02:14:51 He's done nothing wrong.
02:14:52 And I'm looking at some of the
02:14:55 supervisors that want to remove
02:14:55 him.
02:14:56 >> and it's just a shame
02:14:56 because it is black history
02:14:57 month.
02:14:59 I want to say he's a leader.
02:15:00 Let's honor him.
02:15:02 It's black history month today
02:15:03 and why did we bypass the rules
02:15:04 committee and come to this
02:15:06 board of supervisors meeting?
02:15:07 It's really a shame.
02:15:10 I think it's all about
02:15:10 oversight.
02:15:11 >> it's about human rights.
02:15:14 It's also about civil rights.
02:15:15 >> thank you.
02:15:15 Thank you.
02:15:18 Please vote against removing
02:15:18 him.
02:15:21 >> welcome to our next speaker
02:15:21 .
02:15:25 >> hello, I'm here to speak for
02:15:26 max carter over stone.
02:15:27 >> I think he has done an
02:15:29 incredible job.
02:15:30 He has stood up against the
02:15:31 forces of fascism that are
02:15:34 obviously eating the entire
02:15:34 country including and
02:15:37 especially this board of
02:15:38 supervisors.
02:15:38 >> we have decided that our
02:15:41 police don't need any limits.
02:15:42 We've decided that our police
02:15:45 should beat the daylights out
02:15:45 of anyone that's convenient for
02:15:49 our city to maybe prosper.
02:15:50 >> I don't believe that that's
02:15:50 a sane decision.
02:15:52 I want rights.
02:15:53 >> now this is clearly not the
02:15:56 intention of the vast portion
02:16:00 of our mechanized abusive
02:16:00 bureaucracy.
02:16:04 And we have someone standing up
02:16:04 for our rights.
02:16:05 And so what is that person
02:16:07 gotten for it?
02:16:12 Single out specifically and bro
02:16:16 under the boot of our fascism
02:16:17 under your fascism.
02:16:17 >> you want to stand here today
02:16:21 and say that one single voice
02:16:21 on the police commission is too
02:16:24 much.
02:16:25 We can't have one single voice
02:16:25 of oversight.
02:16:28 We can't have a voice of
02:16:29 stability standing up for our
02:16:31 people.
02:16:32 >> instead instead the boot
02:16:35 must grow larger.
02:16:36 The boot must grind harder.
02:16:40 The boot is ineffective.
02:16:41 The boot has never worked.
02:16:44 The reliable resolve of the
02:16:45 boot is more overdoses and more
02:16:47 violence in our community every
02:16:50 time we've tried it and we've
02:16:51 tried it for 60 years over and
02:16:55 over again we've tried the same
02:16:56 drug war and the result of the
02:16:59 same drug war has been an
02:17:02 escalation from opium to heroin
02:17:03 ,from heroin to fentanyl and
02:17:06 from fentanyl design design
02:17:07 in our streets which is
02:17:08 thousands of times more potent
02:17:10 as fentanyl.
02:17:11 Now why is it on our streets?
02:17:14 Why are the homeless in our
02:17:15 communities flesh rotting from
02:17:15 their bones?
02:17:19 Because of your failure to do
02:17:22 your jobs, your failure to do
02:17:23 the oversight that is so
02:17:26 desperately called for over our
02:17:26 unprecedented and unaccountable
02:17:29 police state?
02:17:33 >> thank you for your comments
02:17:33 .
02:17:33 Thank you.
02:17:34 Welcome to our next speaker.
02:17:40 Please.
02:17:41 Hello.
02:17:41 My name is magic.
02:17:44 I've been an activist since I
02:17:48 was 14 years old and worked on
02:17:48 proposition 14 which was to
02:17:52 make black people be able to
02:17:55 buy homes like that person who
02:17:55 was awarded earlier.
02:17:59 >> I've been doing this
02:18:00 activism and I have considered
02:18:02 san francisco to be the
02:18:03 greatest city in the world and
02:18:06 meant to lead us has they have
02:18:07 over and over again in civil
02:18:11 rights in gay rights, in police
02:18:11 activism, in stopping police
02:18:14 brutality.
02:18:15 >> and you sit here and you
02:18:19 will allow a mayor who bought
02:18:22 his way into this position who
02:18:27 doesn't even have the courtesy
02:18:30 to speak to our police
02:18:31 commissioner who has given his
02:18:34 honest devotion.
02:18:35 >> I have been to hundreds of
02:18:36 police commission meetings.
02:18:39 I have been at the sit ins and
02:18:42 the marches and trying to stop
02:18:46 the murder of our people by the
02:18:46 police.
02:18:49 I've been through 272 rulings
02:18:53 that the department of justice
02:18:54 made against our police
02:18:56 department.
02:18:57 And the slow pace at which
02:19:00 they've gone through this.
02:19:01 Now we are dealing with a
02:19:04 fascist coup, a christian
02:19:08 nationalist coup.
02:19:09 >> and you haven't said
02:19:11 anything.
02:19:12 You're not leading the public.
02:19:13 Where is your voice?
02:19:15 Where where's sherman walton?
02:19:19 >> for black history month.
02:19:20 >> come on, walton.
02:19:23 Come out here.
02:19:24 You're black history month and
02:19:27 we need to see you now.
02:19:28 Can you please direct your
02:19:31 comments to the board as a
02:19:32 whole?
02:19:32 >> yes, but I really wonder
02:19:35 about that ruling because I
02:19:35 need to be able to talk
02:19:36 sometimes specifically to
02:19:36 people.
02:19:39 >> so I think that rule is
02:19:39 wrong.
02:19:40 >> you're welcome to set up an
02:19:42 appointment in his office to
02:19:45 speak directly to him or speak
02:19:46 whatever she wants to.
02:19:47 Thank you for your comments.
02:19:52 My comments for the public were
02:19:52 blurry.
02:19:53 >> thank you for your comments.
02:19:57 Time's expired.
02:19:57 Yes, ma'am.
02:20:04 Shame on this for this takeover
02:20:04 .
02:20:05 >> >> thank you for your
02:20:08 comments.
02:20:09 >> are you?
02:20:10 Let's hear from our next
02:20:11 speaker please.
02:20:15 >> welcome.
02:20:16 >> good afternoon.
02:20:17 My name is valerie.
02:20:17 I am a fifth generation san
02:20:20 franciscan born and raised
02:20:21 in the sunset MR. And garcia.
02:20:23 >> I think today's vote is
02:20:24 actually a very easy vote for
02:20:27 all of you because whether
02:20:28 you're going to vote pragmatic
02:20:31 or principled vote it should be
02:20:35 to keep commissioner max carter
02:20:35 ober stone.
02:20:36 >> he's an exemplary public
02:20:38 servant confirmed by this body
02:20:39 to serve out his term.
02:20:42 And I don't want you to be
02:20:43 worried about the political
02:20:43 pressure that you're feeling at
02:20:45 this very moment from the new
02:20:46 mayor laurie.
02:20:47 I'm sure he will have something
02:20:50 that you can support tomorrow
02:20:51 that will not have the same
02:20:54 life or death consequences.
02:20:55 I'm here because it's not just
02:20:58 independent police oversight is
02:21:02 not just a political issue and
02:21:03 I wish that you weren't also
02:21:05 distracted at the moment.
02:21:08 >> this is a personal issue
02:21:09 in 1998 when some of you were
02:21:10 maybe just san francisco
02:21:12 curious san francisco police
02:21:15 department shot and killed my
02:21:16 friend, classmate and teammate
02:21:17 since first grade.
02:21:20 Sheila de toy I don't know if
02:21:21 you know her name but I'll put
02:21:24 her up here so everyone can see
02:21:30 on the on the screen.
02:21:30 >> so in 1998 sheila was
02:21:35 friends with a young man a
02:21:35 young black man who police
02:21:38 wanted in suspicion for
02:21:38 suspicion of drugs of all
02:21:39 things.
02:21:42 >> and they staked out the
02:21:43 place where they were staying
02:21:46 surrounded their car when they
02:21:47 were trying to leave, were
02:21:48 wearing plain clothes, did not
02:21:50 identify themselves as police
02:21:51 officers and shot and killed
02:21:54 sheila for doing it for no
02:21:55 wrongdoing and then went on a
02:21:58 spokesperson from the san
02:21:59 francisco police department
02:21:59 went on to smear her and say
02:22:01 that she was trying to live the
02:22:02 hip hop lifestyle which was
02:22:05 clearly a racist remark.
02:22:09 Anyhow, long story short, they
02:22:10 covered up the misconduct as
02:22:10 they had of the police shooter.
02:22:13 Many times before the police
02:22:16 chief dragged his feet to file
02:22:17 administrative charges and it
02:22:18 was too late because there was
02:22:24 a one year limit of there's
02:22:28 never been justice for sheila.
02:22:29 >> you know, thank you for your
02:22:32 comments, commissioner.
02:22:35 Commissioners thank you.
02:22:39 And so I thank you for your
02:22:42 comments and not necessarily
02:22:42 this one.
02:22:45 >> thank you for your comments
02:22:46 and everyone so we can get
02:22:50 through all of these
02:22:52 individuals who each get two
02:22:53 minutes if you wouldn't mind
02:22:54 holding your applause if you
02:22:56 want to show your support, do
02:22:57 so as such.
02:22:57 >> welcome to our next speaker.
02:23:00 Hello my name is amy bunn and I
02:23:03 live in bernal heights district
02:23:03 nine.
02:23:04 I urge you to vote no on the
02:23:08 motion to remove max carter
02:23:08 ober stone from the police
02:23:11 commission.
02:23:12 The commission is meant to be
02:23:14 an independent body, not an
02:23:15 accessory to the mayor yet
02:23:18 commissioner carter ober stone
02:23:19 exposed unethical behavior on
02:23:22 the part of our previous mayor.
02:23:25 Is mayor lurie concerned about
02:23:26 anything?
02:23:29 >> I don't know.
02:23:30 >> commissioner carter ober
02:23:31 stone has demonstrated his
02:23:34 willingness to act independ
02:23:34 ently and with integrity rather
02:23:35 than protecting his own
02:23:38 interests via fealty to the
02:23:41 mayor.
02:23:42 Lurie's office has not given a
02:23:42 good reason for this removal.
02:23:44 They just say they want someone
02:23:45 who will collaborate to make
02:23:48 our city safer.
02:23:49 >> that's a dog whistle we can
02:23:53 all agree san francisco needs
02:23:54 to be safer.
02:23:57 Our whole country and our whole
02:23:58 world needs to be safer but
02:24:01 safer for whom and by what
02:24:05 means public safety does not
02:24:05 come by way of less oversight,
02:24:09 less transparency or less
02:24:09 accountability.
02:24:12 Public safety grows when
02:24:13 citizens trust their lawmakers
02:24:14 and when those entrusted to
02:24:17 enforce the laws do so fairly
02:24:17 and ethically despite
02:24:20 meaningful police reforms over
02:24:21 the past several years, we know
02:24:24 that there is still a massive
02:24:24 racial disparity in the use of
02:24:25 force.
02:24:28 Commissioner carter ober stone
02:24:28 acknowledges this reality and
02:24:29 rather than sweep it under the
02:24:32 rug he continues to champion
02:24:35 appropriate and necessary
02:24:36 police reform in a city that
02:24:37 does need greater safety for
02:24:40 all its citizens.
02:24:40 >> removing commissioner carter
02:24:43 ober stone before the end of
02:24:44 his term is a politically
02:24:46 motivated move against a man
02:24:47 who rather than being bought is
02:24:51 keeping his eyes on the prize
02:24:54 and I urge you to vote no.
02:24:55 >> you're here and I am a
02:24:58 member of indivisible S.F. And
02:24:59 served showing up for racial
02:24:59 justice.
02:25:03 Those of you who want to be
02:25:04 allies look it up and get on
02:25:04 board.
02:25:06 >> thank you for your comments.
02:25:09 >> next speaker please welcome
02:25:10 good afternoon supervisors.
02:25:13 My name is erica wang and I'm a
02:25:14 constituent of district 11 and
02:25:17 a member of the indivisible
02:25:17 self.
02:25:18 >> I come to you today deeply
02:25:21 disturbed by a national trend I
02:25:22 see being played out here
02:25:25 in our city recently mayor
02:25:26 lurie reaffirmed san
02:25:27 francisco's status as a
02:25:29 sanctuary city protecting
02:25:29 vulnerable residents from
02:25:30 systemic inequalities an unjust
02:25:33 law enforcement actions a move
02:25:33 seen as courageous in the face
02:25:36 of an autocratic.
02:25:37 Around the same time the mayor
02:25:40 began his police overhaul plan
02:25:41 by asking an award winning
02:25:44 independent commissioner to
02:25:45 resign before the end of his
02:25:45 term.
02:25:47 >> only two other commissioners
02:25:48 in S.F. History have left
02:25:49 before their terms of office
02:25:51 both mired in scandal.
02:25:52 >> this is not the case here
02:25:54 something doesn't add up.
02:25:55 The only reason the public has
02:25:59 been given for this move is
02:25:59 that the commissioner isn't
02:26:03 collaborative but isn't an
02:26:03 independent commission meant to
02:26:04 ensure checks and balances a
02:26:07 core function of democracy?
02:26:07 >> independence means making
02:26:10 decisions based on principles,
02:26:11 not political agendas.
02:26:14 So what are we supposed to
02:26:15 think it is mayor lurie saying
02:26:15 he doesn't want an independent
02:26:18 commission to ensure checks and
02:26:19 balances.
02:26:19 >> perhaps the call for this
02:26:22 vote today is a political favor
02:26:25 for sam altman, ceo of open eye
02:26:26 ,co-chair of the transition
02:26:27 team and technology expert and
02:26:30 the police overhaul project who
02:26:30 has a reputation for silencing
02:26:33 whistleblowers supervisors.
02:26:34 >> your decision today will
02:26:37 echo far beyond this chamber.
02:26:38 Do we want to uphold a
02:26:41 democratic institution or do we
02:26:42 allow political maneuvering to
02:26:44 enrich the pockets of the tech
02:26:45 billionaire without oversight?
02:26:49 I urge you to vote no on this
02:26:49 motion.
02:26:50 >> protect the people of san
02:26:50 francisco.
02:26:51 Thank you.
02:26:53 Thank you for your comments.
02:26:56 >> welcome.
02:26:57 >> good afternoon,
02:26:57 commissioners.
02:27:00 My name is paul wormer.
02:27:01 >> I'm district two and I'm
02:27:05 really concerned at this effort
02:27:08 to remove the commissioner.
02:27:09 >> and largely it's a factor of
02:27:12 trust and building trust which
02:27:15 is sadly lacking in this city
02:27:16 and it is affecting everything
02:27:19 from funding for transit to how
02:27:20 we deal with homelessness to
02:27:22 how we provide health care for
02:27:23 the indigent, how we provide
02:27:26 mental health services we need
02:27:27 independent commissioners.
02:27:30 It's great that the mayor gets
02:27:31 to appoint someone who has a
02:27:34 political alignment with them
02:27:35 but then they need to be
02:27:39 independent or the commission
02:27:39 serves no purpose when there
02:27:40 are four appointees from the
02:27:42 mayor on most commissions a
02:27:43 commission that serves no
02:27:47 purpose is a betrayal of the
02:27:50 citizens.
02:27:51 >> the country is different
02:27:53 than a business.
02:27:54 >> the city is different than a
02:27:57 business a ceo has significant
02:28:01 authority to make decisions.
02:28:02 There is employment at will
02:28:04 in california.
02:28:05 >> it is up to the boss to
02:28:09 decide who goes.
02:28:09 This is not the way it works
02:28:13 in a city where one needs to
02:28:16 develop compromise political
02:28:17 solutions that solve problems
02:28:20 but that listen to the people
02:28:20 who are being impacted by
02:28:21 actions.
02:28:24 >> and I will say in my 37
02:28:25 years in san francisco we've
02:28:29 heard a lot about police act
02:28:33 inappropriate police activity.
02:28:36 I am two words two phases or
02:28:36 three phrases come to mind.
02:28:39 Fahey two great cool new tools.
02:28:40 >> some of you MAY remember
02:28:43 those some of you MAY not.
02:28:44 But the history of the police
02:28:47 department not subject to
02:28:48 independent oversight is not
02:28:51 good and I urge you strongly to
02:28:54 reject the mayor's request.
02:28:55 >> thank you.
02:28:58 Thank you for your comments.
02:28:59 >> let's hear from our next
02:28:59 speaker.
02:29:00 Please welcome.
02:29:00 Hello.
02:29:02 My name is sammy and it was
02:29:03 mine and I'm the relations
02:29:06 manager for secure justice and
02:29:06 I'm speaking today to strongly
02:29:07 oppose the removal of police
02:29:11 commissioner max carter over
02:29:11 his work on policies like
02:29:14 limiting pretextual stops
02:29:15 demonstrates his commitment to
02:29:18 evidence based policing and
02:29:19 racial justice.
02:29:21 The california doj MAY have
02:29:22 ended its oversight of S.F. Pd
02:29:25 but racial disparities
02:29:26 in policing still persist.
02:29:29 We need strong independent
02:29:30 commissioners who hold law
02:29:33 enforcement accountable not a
02:29:34 rubber stamp commission
02:29:36 controlled by the mayor.
02:29:37 >> san francisco voters already
02:29:40 have made their stance clear
02:29:40 they've rejected measure d
02:29:41 which would have given the
02:29:44 mayor unchecked power over
02:29:45 police oversight and they
02:29:48 passed measure c to strengthen
02:29:49 accountability and ignoring
02:29:50 this public mandate would be a
02:29:53 disservice to the people you
02:29:54 represent.
02:29:57 Commissioner carter aubuchon is
02:29:58 precisely the kind of leader
02:30:01 that we need in this critical
02:30:02 role and his removal would
02:30:04 weaken public trust and roll
02:30:05 back progress toward true
02:30:06 oversight.
02:30:09 >> and so I urge you to stand
02:30:09 with your constituents and vote
02:30:12 no on this unjust removal.
02:30:13 >> thank you so much.
02:30:14 thank you for your comments.
02:30:16 Welcome.
02:30:20 >> good afternoon.
02:30:21 My name is earl hale.
02:30:21 I'm the director of the
02:30:24 criminal justice team at aclu
02:30:24 of northern california.
02:30:26 The aclu and our 11,000 members
02:30:27 in san francisco urge you to
02:30:31 reject the mayors effort to
02:30:31 remove commissioner carter
02:30:32 overton from the police
02:30:34 commission.
02:30:35 Before you cast your vote on
02:30:36 this important matter, we urge
02:30:39 you to ask yourself why does
02:30:40 mayor lori want to take this
02:30:43 virtually unprecedented step to
02:30:43 remove this police commissioner
02:30:46 from the police commission?
02:30:47 And if this is really about the
02:30:50 mayor wanting his own
02:30:51 appointees on the police
02:30:52 commission, why isn't he asking
02:30:54 the rest of the mayoral
02:30:55 appointees to resign?
02:30:58 Or why he's and he asking you
02:30:58 to remove them from the police
02:30:59 commission?
02:31:02 It's worth noting that
02:31:03 commissioner lary, for example,
02:31:06 was reappointed in 2022 and has
02:31:06 a term that expires at the same
02:31:09 time as commissioner carter
02:31:10 roberston.
02:31:10 However, the key difference
02:31:13 between those two mayoral
02:31:14 appointed commissioners is that
02:31:17 while commissioner oberstar on
02:31:21 carried and championed the
02:31:21 effort to limit pretext stops
02:31:22 and through the san francisco
02:31:25 police commission commissioner
02:31:26 larry carried his appointing
02:31:29 mayor wishes and opposed that
02:31:32 policy.
02:31:33 Removing a black commissioner
02:31:36 during black history month who
02:31:37 is a policing subject matter
02:31:40 expert and has advanced
02:31:40 impactful policies to hold sfpd
02:31:44 accountable and prohibit them
02:31:45 from their current racist
02:31:47 traffic enforcement is a dire
02:31:48 indication of things to come.
02:31:49 Do not let the police
02:31:52 commission become a rubber
02:31:52 stamp commission that fails to
02:31:55 hold sfpd accountable and to
02:31:56 the point about collaboration.
02:31:59 >> commissioner almost on led
02:32:00 the most collaborative policy
02:32:03 in the history of the police
02:32:03 commission when he led the
02:32:07 effort to limit pretext stops.
02:32:08 And this was done because sfpd
02:32:11 was a department that was six
02:32:11 times more likely to stop black
02:32:14 people, ten times more likely
02:32:15 to stop to search black people
02:32:18 for consent searches and 21
02:32:19 times more likely than white
02:32:22 people to use force on black
02:32:25 residents and only make five.
02:32:29 Thank you for commissioner.
02:32:32 >> thank you for your comments
02:32:32 .
02:32:37 >> welcome to the next speaker.
02:32:37 >> thank you.
02:32:40 My name's good afternoon
02:32:44 PRESIDENT Randleman and members
02:32:45 of the board of supervisors.
02:32:47 >> I'm barbara attard.
02:32:48 I'm a second generation san
02:32:49 franciscan.
02:32:52 My granddaughters are fourth
02:32:52 generation.
02:32:53 >> I've worked in oversight
02:32:56 in san francisco since 1983
02:32:57 when we established the office
02:33:00 of citizen complaints.
02:33:04 >> I'm a past PRESIDENT Of
02:33:04 nikole the national association
02:33:05 for civilian oversight of law
02:33:08 enforcement.
02:33:09 >> having worked with the
02:33:12 police commission for many
02:33:15 years, I'm I know how important
02:33:16 it is to have commissioners who
02:33:19 are independent and are
02:33:20 concerned about the importance
02:33:23 of policies and setting
02:33:24 policies that are within
02:33:27 national guidelines.
02:33:28 >> max carter over seven has
02:33:31 shown his serious commitment to
02:33:32 ensuring our police department
02:33:35 policies are developed to keep
02:33:36 all san franciscans safe and by
02:33:39 limiting discretionary stops
02:33:43 and passing legislation and
02:33:43 opposing legislation that we
02:33:47 voted last year to allow more
02:33:47 police chases.
02:33:51 >> we all saw the impact of
02:33:52 that nip add new policy with
02:33:55 the super bowl accident that
02:33:56 caused many, many people to go
02:33:59 to san francisco general
02:33:59 general hospital.
02:34:02 >> I've been told that this
02:34:03 shortsighted and wrong minded
02:34:07 removal of max carter over
02:34:07 stone is about the selection of
02:34:10 a new police chief when it's
02:34:14 time to appoint a new chief.
02:34:15 San francisco must do a
02:34:19 nationwide search and choose
02:34:22 the strongest chief for for our
02:34:23 city.
02:34:23 >> I implore you to do the
02:34:27 right thing to stand up to
02:34:28 mayor lori's self-serving,
02:34:31 highly unusual political
02:34:31 gamesmanship pushing the board
02:34:35 of supervisors to back him.
02:34:36 >> stand up and vote no.
02:34:39 Keep max carter over sloan on
02:34:40 the police commission.
02:34:40 >> thank you.
02:34:43 Thank you, barbara starr for
02:34:44 your comments.
02:34:46 Now welcome to our next speaker
02:34:47 .
02:34:47 >> good afternoon.
02:34:50 My name is rick girling.
02:34:51 >> I'm a resident of bernal
02:34:55 heights, a teacher for 30 years
02:34:56 and I serve usd a member of
02:34:59 ucsf.
02:35:00 >> and I want to say that
02:35:03 living in bernal heights every
02:35:06 time I walk around the hill I
02:35:07 go past a memorial to alex
02:35:10 nieto who was killed by police.
02:35:14 >> and you know, this was a
02:35:15 young man who was a security
02:35:18 guard killed by police for
02:35:19 standing on a bench protecting
02:35:22 himself from a dog that was
02:35:22 attacking him.
02:35:23 >> this is crazy.
02:35:26 And I want people like max to
02:35:30 watch over the police so that
02:35:30 things like that don't continue
02:35:33 to get done and unfortunately
02:35:36 in my district, district nine
02:35:37 just right around the corner is
02:35:40 a lady was saying we just the
02:35:43 average a&e just got its
02:35:47 parklet run down in a police
02:35:47 chase for I think stealing was
02:35:50 what I heard.
02:35:52 And I just find this really
02:35:56 appalling.
02:35:57 >> I would expect the removal
02:36:01 of people who do oversight from
02:36:08 trump, from vance, from musk I
02:36:09 don't expect it from the mayor
02:36:12 of san francisco.
02:36:13 And this is really beyond my
02:36:15 belief.
02:36:19 >> and I, I we need to support
02:36:20 this young man for what he does
02:36:23 and stop you know, the kind of
02:36:24 harassment of oversight.
02:36:24 >> thank you.
02:36:27 Thank you for your comments.
02:36:27 >> welcome.
02:36:30 Good afternoon.
02:36:31 I worked on some of your
02:36:32 campaigns.
02:36:37 Let me remind you.
02:36:38 >> my name is wendy porter.
02:36:41 I am a retired teacher from san
02:36:42 francisco after 40 years.
02:36:42 I'm an immigrant.
02:36:45 I'm a parent.
02:36:46 >> I'm a grandparent.
02:36:46 And I'm just outraged.
02:36:50 i'm totally outraged that we
02:36:50 even have to be here to do
02:36:51 this.
02:36:54 >> MRS. Stir remember her name?
02:36:55 >> melissa sardo.
02:36:58 In 1990 she was murdered by a
02:37:00 san francisco cop.
02:37:01 >> and what I went through was
02:37:04 just outrageous also.
02:37:05 >> my sister was put on trial.
02:37:08 I wish there had been a max
02:37:11 ober stone carter for her.
02:37:12 >> yeah.
02:37:13 If you do this it will set a
02:37:15 precedent.
02:37:16 >> he what else is lori going
02:37:19 to do if he wins this one?
02:37:23 >> then you're sending him a
02:37:23 message that it's he can do
02:37:26 whatever he wants because this
02:37:30 is really, really, really bad.
02:37:31 >> I just I can't believe that
02:37:35 any of you any of you
02:37:36 especially some of you that are
02:37:39 being recalled would even
02:37:42 consider would even consider
02:37:46 voting yes on this do the right
02:37:47 thing.
02:37:48 >> have some done us have some
02:37:51 go on this.
02:37:51 Do the right thing.
02:37:53 Thank you.
02:37:54 >> thank you.
02:37:57 Any porter.
02:38:01 >> speaker welcome.
02:38:01 Good afternoon.
02:38:05 Hi everybody.
02:38:09 >> I as PRESIDENT Of the police
02:38:09 commission sorry marie ravioli.
02:38:12 I am an eighth generation san
02:38:12 franciscan married to an
02:38:16 immigrant so since we're all
02:38:16 sharing that information I
02:38:19 thought I'd let you know as
02:38:20 PRESIDENT Of the commission max
02:38:23 carter over stone went far
02:38:23 beyond the very laudable goal
02:38:27 of police reform and
02:38:30 accountability and overstepped
02:38:34 with a very clearly clear and
02:38:35 strong anti-police agenda that
02:38:38 has impacted public safety for
02:38:39 the last several years and has
02:38:41 restricted officers from
02:38:45 enforcing our laws.
02:38:49 >> hold on one second.
02:38:52 >> the mayor has the right to
02:38:53 have his picks.
02:38:54 Any mayor has the right to have
02:38:56 their picks.
02:38:57 >> mayor breed had the right to
02:38:58 have her picks.
02:39:01 He does not have to and no
02:39:02 mayor has to honor the previous
02:39:05 administration just because it
02:39:08 does not sit well with some
02:39:09 does not mean it is wrong.
02:39:12 It is completely procedural and
02:39:13 it is completely within the
02:39:16 bounds of the law.
02:39:19 At the end of the day the mayor
02:39:20 is empowered by the charter to
02:39:21 have four picks on the
02:39:23 commission.
02:39:24 If the current mayor believes
02:39:28 that this particular pick does
02:39:32 not reflect the goals of his
02:39:32 administration, it is well
02:39:35 within his rights to request to
02:39:39 to remove him and to request
02:39:40 approval from this body.
02:39:43 >> thank you.
02:39:44 >> let's hear from our next
02:39:47 speaker please.
02:39:48 >> thank you very much, kevin
02:39:51 benedict.
02:39:51 Thank you PRESIDENT Randleman
02:39:52 and supervisors.
02:39:54 I have the privilege to serve
02:39:55 alongside commissioner carter
02:39:56 ober stone on the police
02:39:58 commission and I'm here to ask
02:39:59 that he be allowed to complete
02:40:02 his term the while as vice
02:40:03 PRESIDENT Of police commission.
02:40:05 I've gotten to work closely and
02:40:06 it's nothing you haven't heard
02:40:07 that commissioner carter ober
02:40:09 stone has been a fearless and
02:40:10 tireless advocate of
02:40:13 independent police reform
02:40:14 values which I think all of us
02:40:17 share in san francisco.
02:40:17 We've worked closely together
02:40:18 on a number of issues we've not
02:40:21 agreed on every single issue
02:40:21 but he is someone that can be
02:40:22 worked with.
02:40:24 I think I want to address
02:40:25 something head on that's been
02:40:26 the subject of a lot of
02:40:26 discussion which is whether or
02:40:28 not commissioner
02:40:29 cartier-bresson is
02:40:29 collaborative and I can tell
02:40:32 each I remember the board
02:40:33 supervisors to look past the
02:40:34 talking points.
02:40:36 >> I can tell you that he is
02:40:37 collaborative and I have a
02:40:38 couple of specific examples.
02:40:40 One is you heard that the vice
02:40:41 PRESIDENT Spearheaded the
02:40:43 effort to limit pre-check stops
02:40:44 here in san francisco and
02:40:47 in that process undertook the
02:40:48 most open, most collaborative
02:40:50 general order writing process
02:40:51 in the department's modern
02:40:51 history.
02:40:52 It included town halls, closed
02:40:54 door office town halls,
02:40:55 multiple focus groups and a
02:40:58 truly comprehensive process
02:40:58 that was collaborative in every
02:41:01 stage and every step of the
02:41:02 way.
02:41:02 Another specific example I'd
02:41:05 like to share with the board is
02:41:05 with respect to what's called
02:41:06 the preemptive deployment of
02:41:09 tire deflation devices commonly
02:41:10 known as spike strips.
02:41:10 >> last year the department
02:41:13 issued an order believing that
02:41:14 their use of them might be
02:41:17 outside of existing procedures
02:41:17 and stop that use.
02:41:21 In response to that and
02:41:21 in response to hearing from
02:41:22 rank and file officers, the
02:41:25 vice PRESIDENT Moved swiftly to
02:41:25 implement an order to
02:41:28 accelerate the return of those
02:41:29 to allow them to be used on the
02:41:30 streets because data showed
02:41:33 those were effective tools.
02:41:33 And finally just recently with
02:41:34 a body worn camera policy, it
02:41:36 was the vice PRESIDENT That
02:41:37 pushed us to revert back to an
02:41:38 earlier draft.
02:41:41 And in the end the final
02:41:41 version of the body worn camera
02:41:42 policy passed unanimously.
02:41:44 In large part thanks to the
02:41:45 tremendous work of the vice
02:41:46 PRESIDENT, he is collaborative.
02:41:48 He is a supporter of an
02:41:49 independent police reform and
02:41:49 should be allowed to finish his
02:41:50 term.
02:41:51 Thank you.
02:41:52 >> thank you for your comments.
02:41:55 Welcome.
02:41:59 >> hello.
02:42:00 My name is jordan neal,
02:42:00 district four representing the
02:42:01 electoral board of the
02:42:03 democratic socialists of
02:42:04 america san francisco chapter.
02:42:05 The members of our chapter have
02:42:07 asked us to provide public
02:42:08 comment opposing the removal of
02:42:08 commissioner max carter over
02:42:10 stone.
02:42:11 We're thankful to supervisor
02:42:12 jackie fielder for committing
02:42:14 to oppose his removal and hope
02:42:15 that her fellow supervisors
02:42:15 will follow her leadership
02:42:18 considering the commissioner's
02:42:19 record, it's clear why the
02:42:20 members of dsa staff hold max
02:42:22 in such high regard.
02:42:23 He's been a tireless advocate
02:42:23 for reform and transparent
02:42:26 civilian oversight.
02:42:27 The commissioner refused an
02:42:27 illegal order from the former
02:42:30 mayor to sign an undated
02:42:30 resignation letter.
02:42:31 In 2023 he overturned the spd's
02:42:34 attempt to circumvent the
02:42:35 police commission's oversight
02:42:37 by issuing two secret orders
02:42:37 without the commission's
02:42:38 approval.
02:42:38 >> he fought for critical
02:42:41 reforms against racist policing
02:42:41 practices in the form of
02:42:44 pretextual traffic stops by
02:42:45 voting for general order 9.07.
02:42:47 >> in short, it's clear that
02:42:48 the commissioner had a history
02:42:49 of taking firm principled
02:42:52 stances against illegal orders,
02:42:53 against racial injustice and
02:42:56 against abuses of power that
02:42:57 would harm everyday san
02:42:57 franciscans.
02:42:58 >> the mayor has asked the
02:43:01 board of supervisors to force
02:43:01 the resignation of this
02:43:02 principled reformer.
02:43:04 >> why?
02:43:05 >> why?
02:43:06 The mayor has no argument
02:43:08 in favor of this ask.
02:43:09 There is no cited malfeasance.
02:43:12 There's no cited misconduct.
02:43:13 >> san francisco's voters have
02:43:13 repeatedly voted in favor of
02:43:15 independent transparent
02:43:16 oversight of the city's police
02:43:17 department.
02:43:19 They did not vote for a police
02:43:20 commission that simply serves
02:43:20 the interest of the mayor's
02:43:22 office.
02:43:23 Removing a commissioner who has
02:43:24 demonstrated independence and
02:43:26 integrity undermines public
02:43:27 trust in both the police
02:43:31 commission and in the board of
02:43:31 supervisors.
02:43:34 >> today I urge you to take a
02:43:35 page from commissioner carter
02:43:35 over stone's playbook and take
02:43:38 a principled stance.
02:43:39 refuse mayor lurie's political
02:43:39 interference in the police
02:43:42 commission.
02:43:43 >> thank you for your time.
02:43:45 Thank you for your comments.
02:43:46 >> you welcome.
02:43:50 Perfect.
02:43:50 Hey there.
02:43:51 I'm demar abe randy in district
02:43:52 three resident and a
02:43:53 representative home middle
02:43:54 club.
02:43:54 Like many here, I'm here to
02:43:57 speak in support of allowing
02:43:57 MR. Carter over stone to finish
02:43:58 the last year of his term.
02:44:01 I will say I find it profoundly
02:44:03 ironic that we just spent the
02:44:04 last hour and a half two hours
02:44:05 recognizing and honoring black
02:44:07 and brown leaders and
02:44:08 visionaries who dedicated
02:44:09 themselves to uplifting their
02:44:11 communities only to hear a
02:44:12 resolute resolution aimed at
02:44:13 tearing down another
02:44:15 immediately after.
02:44:15 I find it shameful then when
02:44:19 MR. Carter over stone was
02:44:19 addressing you.
02:44:20 Many of you didn't even have
02:44:21 enough respect to look him
02:44:23 in the eyes though you're
02:44:24 deciding his fate.
02:44:27 I moved here from the south
02:44:27 in hopes of escaping
02:44:30 miscarriages of justice such as
02:44:31 what I'm seeing today and hopes
02:44:32 of finally being somewhere
02:44:35 where I can feel safe in my own
02:44:35 skin only to find myself
02:44:36 surrounded by pseudo
02:44:39 conservatives and neo liberals
02:44:40 hiding behind a thin veil of
02:44:43 liberalism spouting hateful
02:44:44 rhetoric akin to mcconnell of
02:44:44 my home state of kentucky.
02:44:47 I found san francisco is not an
02:44:48 anti-racist city and instead a
02:44:51 city with a sordid history of
02:44:52 displacing black and latino
02:44:54 communities repeatedly a
02:44:55 history of racially biased
02:44:55 policies that unfairly targeted
02:44:58 black latino and arab
02:44:59 communities and a city
02:45:02 in support of anti vagrancy
02:45:03 laws that are reminiscent of
02:45:04 the jim crow south.
02:45:07 >> I found that when an
02:45:07 experienced, competent
02:45:10 individual comes forward to say
02:45:11 we should end the policies that
02:45:12 everyone in this room has
02:45:14 mentioned he is persecuted as
02:45:15 being disagreeable.
02:45:18 Which only leads me to wonder
02:45:19 what it is that this new
02:45:19 administration's plans are when
02:45:22 it comes to policing especially
02:45:22 when its head was recently
02:45:23 quoted in fox news as being
02:45:26 inspired by a former republican
02:45:26 known for supporting policies
02:45:27 that terrorized black
02:45:30 communities for over a decade.
02:45:31 We're facing an antagonistic
02:45:34 federal administration
02:45:34 trampling civil rights.
02:45:35 We know overpolicing doesn't
02:45:36 work and we know we need a
02:45:38 multifaith city approach aimed
02:45:39 at solving the underlying
02:45:40 issues of substance abuse and
02:45:42 homelessness.
02:45:43 Max understands this and we
02:45:46 should lead by example and
02:45:47 retain him because he will
02:45:47 fight for what we need.
02:45:50 >> thank you for your comments.
02:45:53 >> welcome to the next speaker
02:45:54 .
02:45:54 >> hi everyone.
02:45:55 I'm on your world.
02:45:55 Zimmerman.
02:45:58 I'm here in my capacity on the
02:45:58 electoral board of the
02:45:59 democratic socialists of
02:46:02 america as of chapter and I'm
02:46:03 in district three resident and
02:46:05 i'm also here to speak on
02:46:06 behalf of my own experiences.
02:46:09 >> why is the mayor removing
02:46:09 max carter oppression?
02:46:13 >> why is a critical question
02:46:14 and it remains deliberately and
02:46:14 disrespectfully unanswered.
02:46:17 Why would an independent police
02:46:20 commissioner be a roadblock to
02:46:20 mayor lurie's plans?
02:46:21 It's extremely concerning.
02:46:24 I expect you to dwell on this
02:46:25 and scrutinize what comes next
02:46:27 from the police commission.
02:46:28 >> if this isn't your fight on
02:46:32 public safety, we ask you what
02:46:35 is what is your fight on public
02:46:35 safety?
02:46:36 >> I had a whole tactful
02:46:39 statement but bear with me as
02:46:43 I'm inspired by everybody who
02:46:44 has shared to share what public
02:46:44 safety is to me.
02:46:47 >> I cannot express how many
02:46:50 times I've hovered over a phone
02:46:50 dialed 2911 and never called.
02:46:54 I never would ever think to
02:46:57 call because of policies like
02:47:00 the S.F. Pd's policy of keeping
02:47:04 the dna of rape victims.
02:47:05 >> that is violence.
02:47:05 That is violence perpetrated by
02:47:08 the S.F. Pd.
02:47:09 >> we can't just sit here and
02:47:10 talk about the police
02:47:12 department as if they are not
02:47:13 committing deliberate violence.
02:47:16 >> when you talk about public
02:47:17 safety, I expect you to know
02:47:20 that public safety is not the
02:47:20 cops.
02:47:24 >> I pray that none of you ever
02:47:24 experience what it's like to be
02:47:28 afraid of the police and what
02:47:29 they are going to do to you.
02:47:30 >> but I encourage you to
02:47:32 listen to those who are to know
02:47:33 that violence is in our homes
02:47:36 and domestic violence in sexual
02:47:36 violence and these answers are
02:47:40 not met by the cops.
02:47:41 They are so often not met by
02:47:41 the cops.
02:47:44 I ask you what public safety
02:47:45 really is and I tell you that
02:47:48 public safety is not the cops
02:47:48 public safety as max carter
02:47:52 oliver stone who has fought for
02:47:55 public safety from the S.F. Pd
02:47:55 .
02:47:56 >> he has stopped the violence
02:47:59 coming from within our own
02:47:59 halls of justice.
02:48:03 There is nothing more safe than
02:48:03 police oversight.
02:48:04 It is not a blank check to the
02:48:04 police.
02:48:08 You will see me here again and
02:48:11 again as we demand over and
02:48:11 over again.
02:48:12 >> and we thank you supervisor
02:48:15 melgar and supervisor fielder,
02:48:16 thank you for your courageous
02:48:16 justice on this.
02:48:19 >> thank you for your comments
02:48:19 ,mike.
02:48:22 >> welcome to our next speaker.
02:48:23 >> hi my name is gloria
02:48:23 massachusetts.
02:48:26 I'm coming here as a d9 mother
02:48:27 and a public educator for many
02:48:30 years with S.F. Unified for
02:48:31 those supervisors that MAY not
02:48:34 have lived in this city back
02:48:35 when my child my children were
02:48:35 younger.
02:48:38 I learned about the killing of
02:48:38 alex nieto by the police
02:48:39 officers with 49 empty shell
02:48:42 cases up at the top of bernal
02:48:43 hill at the carnival because
02:48:45 someone put a table up there to
02:48:46 inform the public.
02:48:47 The police went to his home and
02:48:50 did not tell his parents that
02:48:51 they had murdered their their
02:48:53 child and ransacked through
02:48:54 their house and his car.
02:48:57 Amilcar perez lopez was killed
02:48:58 a block around right around the
02:49:01 corner from our home.
02:49:02 In that same time frame.
02:49:05 Louis pat gongora was shot
02:49:08 while sitting on the ground a
02:49:09 block from my house as I
02:49:09 brought my four year old home
02:49:12 that day.
02:49:13 >> I went to walk my dog to see
02:49:13 what had happened and police
02:49:16 officers all they had top brass
02:49:17 were there and that family was
02:49:20 settled with.
02:49:20 This is a matter of life and
02:49:24 death oversight does keep the
02:49:25 community safe.
02:49:25 I can't even add to what these
02:49:28 amazing speakers have said to
02:49:28 you today.
02:49:29 But I'd really like you to be
02:49:30 off your phones and maybe
02:49:32 listening a little bit because
02:49:33 there's been murders in this
02:49:36 city by the police and we don't
02:49:40 need to we don't need to repeat
02:49:41 this.
02:49:42 >> it is a matter of life and
02:49:42 death.
02:49:42 Thank you.
02:49:47 Thank you for your comments.
02:49:50 >> it's just unbelievable.
02:49:51 Tanisha carlos of fillmore
02:49:54 district resident I'm here
02:49:55 today to express my disgust
02:49:58 with the mayor's attempt to
02:49:59 remove police commissioner
02:49:59 ultrasound.
02:50:02 What exactly does the mayor
02:50:03 mean when he seeks someone who
02:50:06 works collaboratively?
02:50:07 Because from where I stand,
02:50:08 commissioner oliver stone has
02:50:10 collaborated extensively with
02:50:11 community stakeholders
02:50:14 department leadership and
02:50:15 fellow fellow commissioners.
02:50:18 He simply hasn't shied away
02:50:19 from difficult questions.
02:50:22 I question whether the mayor's
02:50:22 definition of collaboration
02:50:26 might actually mean compliance
02:50:27 with a predetermined agenda.
02:50:30 >> is a stab is challenging
02:50:31 established practices and
02:50:34 advocating for historically
02:50:35 marginal marginalized
02:50:35 communities.
02:50:38 Consider it uncooperative.
02:50:42 How does removing commissioner
02:50:42 oliver stone advance public
02:50:46 safety in black and brown
02:50:46 communities?
02:50:47 What specific examples can be
02:50:50 provided where commissioner
02:50:50 oliver stone has been
02:50:54 uncooperative in a way that
02:50:54 hindered rather than enhance
02:50:57 public safety?
02:50:58 >> I strongly urge you to base
02:51:02 the decision making process on
02:51:06 facts versus personal opinions
02:51:06 publicly stating that
02:51:07 commissioner obra stone is not
02:51:11 classy for his decision to not
02:51:12 resign but rather fight for
02:51:14 those who need him.
02:51:15 Says more about the lack of
02:51:16 class in the person making the
02:51:18 statement than it does about
02:51:19 the person.
02:51:22 The failed insult was half bad.
02:51:23 If you want to understand any
02:51:27 problem in america you need to
02:51:28 focus on who profits from the
02:51:31 problem not who suffers from
02:51:31 the problem.
02:51:34 What is the profit to harming
02:51:38 and killing black bodies to
02:51:42 this body of of constituents
02:51:42 and to the mayor?
02:51:43 >> thank you.
02:51:46 Thank you for your comments.
02:51:54 >> welcome.
02:51:57 >> my name is christopher mica
02:51:57 .
02:51:58 I'm coming to this discussion
02:52:00 today.
02:52:01 I think about my friend in new
02:52:05 york who I found has been
02:52:05 recently made homeless since
02:52:08 the beginning of the year and
02:52:09 were was beat brutally by the
02:52:13 police in new york city a few
02:52:16 weeks ago to within an inch of
02:52:16 their life.
02:52:19 And I just found this out last
02:52:20 night and I talked to them.
02:52:22 I don't think I'll be as
02:52:26 articulate as folks who have
02:52:27 spoken already.
02:52:27 I think it's really great
02:52:31 commentary and but I'm struck
02:52:32 by the richness of all their
02:52:34 comments.
02:52:35 The citizens in san francisco
02:52:38 see clearly the politicking
02:52:38 behind this attempt to remove a
02:52:41 police commissioner.
02:52:42 We simply need independent
02:52:45 accountability and oversight
02:52:46 for the police removal of max
02:52:49 carter over stone who has no
02:52:50 ethical violations and has done
02:52:52 nothing wrong and pressuring
02:52:53 him to resign shows incredible
02:52:54 hubris.
02:53:00 >> and why why if this removal
02:53:01 is truly about making san
02:53:02 francisco safer, why is the
02:53:04 mayor targeting a commissioner
02:53:05 who has worked to prevent
02:53:05 police discrimination and
02:53:08 misconduct?
02:53:09 We need oversight that protects
02:53:12 all residents not just those
02:53:13 with political power or those
02:53:13 who can organize millions
02:53:17 in campaign donations.
02:53:17 I strongly urge the board to
02:53:18 vote no on this removal of mask
02:53:20 cover over stone.
02:53:21 And I want to thank jackie
02:53:24 fielder and myrna for their
02:53:25 support on this.
02:53:25 >> thank you.
02:53:28 Thank you for your comments.
02:53:28 >> oh no.
02:53:31 Welcome to the next speaker.
02:53:31 Good afternoon.
02:53:32 I'm janelle caywood.
02:53:34 I'm a 30 year resident of
02:53:35 district district three.
02:53:38 >> I'm an attorney for almost
02:53:39 as long and I'm here in my
02:53:39 personal capacity.
02:53:42 I've had the pleasure of
02:53:43 working with max carter over
02:53:45 stone for a number of years.
02:53:46 He is brilliant, truthful,
02:53:50 courageous and deeply kind.
02:53:50 >> max's only so-called sin is
02:53:54 that he doesn't politic nor
02:53:54 should he.
02:53:55 >> he's a family man and a
02:53:55 volunteer.
02:53:58 He has no political
02:53:58 aspirations.
02:54:02 He doesn't glad handle schmooze
02:54:03 kiss rings or brown nose.
02:54:05 He is collaborative
02:54:06 collaborative with people from
02:54:07 all walks of life.
02:54:09 >> when he's approached with
02:54:10 good intent but if you come at
02:54:14 him with cover ups bad data or
02:54:15 gaslighting, max doesn't play
02:54:18 as a commissioner.
02:54:19 He has taken bold and swift
02:54:19 action to protect the public
02:54:22 and to ensure that our policing
02:54:23 strategies are effective
02:54:25 evidence based and don't
02:54:26 impermissibly target people of
02:54:26 color.
02:54:30 >> max's bold action and
02:54:30 truthful criticism hasn't
02:54:33 always made him popular with
02:54:34 police brass.
02:54:34 But in the words of dwayne wade
02:54:38 big time players make big time
02:54:38 plays.
02:54:41 >> we as a community owe max a
02:54:42 debt of gratitude for
02:54:46 volunteering his time.
02:54:46 His rock solid ethical core and
02:54:50 his intention to do right even
02:54:50 when attacked in unfairly
02:54:51 demonized.
02:54:54 >> I am aware that max has met
02:54:57 with police officers off duty
02:54:58 in his own time who are
02:55:01 suffering in this trump era.
02:55:02 Women and officers of color who
02:55:05 don't feel supported by their
02:55:05 superiors.
02:55:06 He's compassionate and my phone
02:55:09 is full of these compliments.
02:55:12 Max's existence has made us all
02:55:13 who know him more ethical and
02:55:13 more courageous.
02:55:16 He is to be commended for
02:55:17 prioritizing truth, justice and
02:55:20 true safety over politics.
02:55:21 Working with him has been an
02:55:24 honor of a lifetime.
02:55:24 Whatever happens today, max,
02:55:25 thank you for who you are and
02:55:27 for being in the arena daring
02:55:28 greatly.
02:55:32 >> thank you for your comments.
02:55:32 Welcome nick.
02:55:35 Speaker.
02:55:36 >> good afternoon supervisors
02:55:39 on musc with care at the
02:55:40 council on american-islamic
02:55:41 relations and I stand before
02:55:43 you today in step with our
02:55:44 allies in opposing the unjust
02:55:47 removal of police commissioner
02:55:47 max carter over stone.
02:55:48 >> commissioner carter over
02:55:50 stone has been a persistent
02:55:51 reliable advocate for police
02:55:54 accountability and data driven
02:55:55 independent oversight.
02:55:55 Under his leadership he limited
02:55:58 abuse of pretexts, traffic
02:55:58 stops, expose corruption and
02:56:02 fought police brutality.
02:56:03 His removal would mean the city
02:56:04 of san francisco sanctioning
02:56:06 further police misconduct and
02:56:07 abuse abuse that includes
02:56:10 racist text messages, unlawful
02:56:11 use of force and misconduct
02:56:11 disproportionately harming
02:56:14 black and brown individuals.
02:56:14 >> the people of san francisco
02:56:17 have consistently voted
02:56:18 in favor of independent
02:56:19 oversight and against the
02:56:19 consolidation of power.
02:56:23 The city does not need a police
02:56:24 commission stacked with rubber
02:56:26 stamp appointees that erase
02:56:27 police oversight.
02:56:27 It needs commissioners like
02:56:30 commissioner carter over stone
02:56:31 to who rely on hard data,
02:56:34 listen to the community and
02:56:34 push for substantial reform.
02:56:35 His removal would weaken the
02:56:38 already diminished public trust
02:56:38 and erode the oversight that
02:56:42 the san francisco community has
02:56:42 repeatedly demanded and voted
02:56:43 for.
02:56:43 >> the board must push for real
02:56:46 cultural change within the san
02:56:47 francisco police department and
02:56:49 city hall not dismantling
02:56:50 oversight and transparency at
02:56:54 the expense of public safety.
02:56:54 So once again we strongly urge
02:56:55 you to vote against the removal
02:56:58 of commissioner carter over
02:56:59 stone and to let him finish his
02:57:02 term and deliver justice.
02:57:02 >> thank you.
02:57:03 Thank you for your comments.
02:57:05 Your next speaker.
02:57:06 >> good afternoon.
02:57:09 PRESIDENT Benjamin supervisors.
02:57:10 My name is lawrence lee.
02:57:13 I'm a san francisco native and
02:57:14 a former member of a civil
02:57:17 grand jury.
02:57:18 And today I'm speaking as one
02:57:21 of the board members of the
02:57:21 advancement of victims and the
02:57:25 association for the advancement
02:57:25 of asians.
02:57:26 >> we are a new group that does
02:57:29 report cards on mayors and
02:57:30 supervisors and super
02:57:32 candidates on their votes.
02:57:33 And one of the key topics of
02:57:36 our group is public safety.
02:57:40 So this was a tough one for our
02:57:41 board to consider.
02:57:44 We really appreciate all the
02:57:44 efforts that commissioner
02:57:48 cordova stone has been doing.
02:57:48 We support his efforts at
02:57:52 independence accountability,
02:57:52 reform and oversight.
02:57:56 And in the end we agree with
02:57:57 mayor lori that we need a
02:58:00 commissioner that is for
02:58:01 collaboration and communication
02:58:01 for asian-americans in san
02:58:04 francisco from the richmond
02:58:05 district to visitation valley.
02:58:08 Have clearly stated over and
02:58:09 over again they want to be safe
02:58:12 for the grandparents and for
02:58:12 the sons and daughters of san
02:58:15 francisco not just
02:58:16 asian-american.
02:58:17 We would love to have a city
02:58:20 that's better, that's safer and
02:58:20 that's freer.
02:58:21 And so we encourage you
02:58:24 supervise others to support
02:58:24 this motion.
02:58:27 >> thank you.
02:58:28 Can we hear from our next
02:58:31 speaker please?
02:58:31 >> hey there.
02:58:35 Good afternoon, supervisors.
02:58:36 I'm caleb karam, a district
02:58:39 eight resident here in support
02:58:40 of max carter over stone.
02:58:43 >> as important as his many
02:58:44 accomplishments are, I've got
02:58:45 limited time.
02:58:47 You heard them from him when he
02:58:48 came up here and from the
02:58:48 community.
02:58:51 And the thing is I hope you are
02:58:54 paying attention because our
02:58:54 is designed to put y'all.
02:58:58 This board is supervisors.
02:58:59 The people have been trusted
02:59:03 for terms by the people of
02:59:03 their distinct neighborhoods
02:59:06 in charge of final say over the
02:59:07 removal of someone from the
02:59:07 police commission.
02:59:10 Your constituents are here.
02:59:14 I know they've written in.
02:59:14 >> please listen to them.
02:59:17 And I've heard there's a rumor
02:59:18 of this excuse.
02:59:21 The reason it's it's an excuse
02:59:24 it's not a particularly good
02:59:24 one.
02:59:25 It's not one that laurie saw
02:59:28 fit to tell the press to make
02:59:29 formal accusations about to
02:59:32 bring up before a couple of
02:59:33 weeks ago.
02:59:37 Neither mayor breed and I'd
02:59:37 frankly like saying he's on
02:59:40 collaborative or difficult is
02:59:41 heresy to all folks who have
02:59:44 worked with him or talked to
02:59:47 him or attended his commission
02:59:48 .
02:59:48 I would encourage you to let
02:59:51 max carter over stone serve the
02:59:52 rest of his term.
02:59:53 Florrie would like to have more
02:59:55 influence over the commission.
02:59:55 He is welcome to appoint
02:59:59 someone when max his term is
02:59:59 over.
03:00:00 >> thank you very much.
03:00:00 Thank you for your comments.
03:00:05 Next speakers.
03:00:10 Hi my name is lawrence berlin.
03:00:10 I'm a long time mission
03:00:13 resident, a labor organizer
03:00:14 in the tech industry and a
03:00:17 member of the harvey milk lgbtq
03:00:17 club board.
03:00:18 I'm here to speak today
03:00:20 in favor of max carter over
03:00:21 stone and more specifically to
03:00:24 lay out an alternative path for
03:00:25 the board of supervisors from a
03:00:26 political perspective.
03:00:28 I believe people have already
03:00:29 spoken at length about MR. Over
03:00:31 stone's carter over stone's
03:00:32 many positive traits and why he
03:00:35 should remain on this board.
03:00:38 >> people have spoken about the
03:00:39 legal authority of the mayor to
03:00:40 remove people and to make this
03:00:43 request that's absolutely
03:00:43 legal.
03:00:44 There's a reason that this
03:00:47 board has to vote for or
03:00:47 against that request and I urge
03:00:51 this board to delay that vote
03:00:52 that it can discuss a larger
03:00:52 move towards an independent
03:00:55 police commission whose
03:00:55 majority members are not
03:00:58 appointed by the mayor.
03:00:59 It is within this board's power
03:01:02 to remake the nature of these
03:01:02 commissions fundamentally so
03:01:05 that san francisco so that san
03:01:06 francisco can have the
03:01:07 independent police commission
03:01:10 that it deserves.
03:01:11 I urge you to keep max carter
03:01:13 over stone on the police
03:01:14 commission until such time as
03:01:15 you can make that change
03:01:17 because I assume it will take
03:01:18 time to work that out.
03:01:18 And his presence is the only
03:01:21 thing ensuring that the
03:01:22 commission has any independence
03:01:22 at this time.
03:01:26 >> you can delay your vote.
03:01:26 You can discuss this.
03:01:29 You can consider the political
03:01:29 ramifications of that.
03:01:30 I know that there is a lot of
03:01:32 quotes in the media from many
03:01:33 members of this board about
03:01:36 political capital, about
03:01:37 classiness, about
03:01:37 collaboration.
03:01:41 >> I believe that those are
03:01:42 things that you can work on.
03:01:42 >> I don't think that this is
03:01:44 the place to waste your
03:01:45 political capital with the
03:01:48 people.
03:01:49 And I would take note of an
03:01:50 article from mission local
03:01:52 analyzing the election results
03:01:53 last fall that indicated that
03:01:53 the most leftist groups in this
03:01:56 city including the one that I'm
03:01:57 a board member of had the most
03:02:00 success in their endorsement
03:02:01 in votes in both propositions
03:02:04 and candidates.
03:02:04 >> and consider how people will
03:02:05 be voting on all of your future
03:02:08 political careers should your
03:02:08 decisions not align with the
03:02:12 people on independence of the
03:02:12 police commission.
03:02:13 >> thank you for your time.
03:02:15 Thank you for your comments.
03:02:16 >> welcome to our next speaker.
03:02:19 Thank you.
03:02:20 Good afternoon.
03:02:21 My name you are welcome to pull
03:02:21 the microphone close.
03:02:23 There you go.
03:02:24 >> my name is alexi folger.
03:02:26 I'm a 31 year resident of
03:02:27 district eight.
03:02:28 >> good afternoon, PRESIDENT
03:02:28 Mendelsohn.
03:02:31 I'm here as a supporter of the
03:02:32 aclu and an appreciation for
03:02:35 the work they do to promote
03:02:38 genuine community safety and
03:02:39 police accountability.
03:02:39 I'm not sure I have anything
03:02:43 terribly new to say but I think
03:02:43 there's an argument for
03:02:46 quantity as well as quantity
03:02:46 just to reinforce the point.
03:02:50 What san francisco needs right
03:02:53 now is not to emulate what's
03:02:53 going on in the federal.
03:02:57 >> what we do need is
03:02:57 independent principled
03:03:00 oversight of the police
03:03:01 department and protection of
03:03:04 our civil rights, the
03:03:04 independence of the police
03:03:08 commission is more important
03:03:09 than the mayor's desire to
03:03:12 politicize it.
03:03:13 >> just today he got to fill an
03:03:16 empty seat.
03:03:17 >> did you know?
03:03:19 So that's his right in the
03:03:23 charter and that's enough.
03:03:23 The independence of the police
03:03:27 commission is paramount.
03:03:30 The recent police chase fiasco
03:03:31 is a clear indication that the
03:03:34 S.F. Pd needs clear and
03:03:38 continual careful oversight by
03:03:39 commissioners beholden as he
03:03:43 himself said only to the people
03:03:44 of san francisco and not to the
03:03:47 new administra ation.
03:03:48 >> removing a member of the
03:03:51 police commission or any other
03:03:51 independent commission for no
03:03:55 cause when they still have
03:03:56 significant time left on their
03:04:00 term will send a very bad doge
03:04:03 worthy message.
03:04:03 >> okay.
03:04:07 If san francisco goes the way
03:04:08 of doge where else can we go?
03:04:11 >> there will be no safe place
03:04:14 in the united states.
03:04:18 >> so as a white anti-racist
03:04:22 san franciscan my job is
03:04:22 solidarity.
03:04:25 >> I'm showing that today by
03:04:26 taking the afternoon off of
03:04:29 work to be with you.
03:04:29 >> thank you.
03:04:30 Thank you for your comments.
03:04:33 Next speaker welcome.
03:04:36 >> please.
03:04:37 >> good afternoon.
03:04:41 My name's richard ivanhoe.
03:04:44 I belong to a number of
03:04:45 organizations but these
03:04:48 comments are as an individual.
03:04:52 First off, statistics show that
03:04:55 san francisco crime is down.
03:04:59 Its safe was safer in 2024 than
03:05:02 2023.
03:05:02 But more importantly I'm here
03:05:05 to talk about timing.
03:05:09 Others have pointed out that
03:05:13 this is black history month.
03:05:13 This is the wrong time to
03:05:17 remove an african-american
03:05:20 commissioner but even more so
03:05:25 we are sending a message.
03:05:26 If we remove commissioner
03:05:30 carter over stone that we are
03:05:33 aligned with what's going on
03:05:33 in the federal.
03:05:37 Not a message we want to send
03:05:40 to the rest of the nation that
03:05:44 service is subject to the whims
03:05:45 and pleasure of the chief
03:05:49 executive officer and the
03:05:52 billionaire donors behind them
03:05:53 .
03:05:56 >> so supervisors, if you can't
03:06:00 find the courage to vote no,
03:06:01 I'm asking you to at least find
03:06:04 the courage to postpone this
03:06:08 vote until things are a little
03:06:09 bit different in the nation.
03:06:10 >> thank you.
03:06:12 Thank you, MR. Avenue.
03:06:16 >> next speaker, please.
03:06:17 >> good afternoon.
03:06:17 I'm tab buckner.
03:06:20 I'm on the board of the
03:06:21 haight-ashbury neighborhood
03:06:21 council.
03:06:23 I'm going to speak briefly on
03:06:24 behalf of the board
03:06:25 in recognition of the passage
03:06:28 of bro both prop c and the
03:06:28 rejection of prop d last
03:06:31 NOVEMBER.
03:06:31 >> clearly your constituents
03:06:34 want to see less mayoral
03:06:38 overreach and more
03:06:38 accountability and independence
03:06:41 on our commissions which is how
03:06:45 our city charter is designed.
03:06:45 >> clearly we recognize also
03:06:49 the incredible work that MR.
03:06:50 Carter opus stone has done his
03:06:54 diligence, his dedication, his
03:06:54 not worrying about who's who
03:06:57 appointed him but what was the
03:06:58 right thing.
03:07:01 Working very successfully in a
03:07:02 collaborative manner with
03:07:03 individuals and different
03:07:05 departments in the city.
03:07:06 It makes absolutely no sense to
03:07:09 remove him at this time.
03:07:10 The mayor did not give him any
03:07:10 courtesy at all to meet with
03:07:13 him or explain in detail why
03:07:13 this is going on.
03:07:16 So first of all, I want to say
03:07:17 thank you, commissioner, for
03:07:22 all of your incredible work and
03:07:23 just on a final note, I feel
03:07:24 this is an embarrassment we're
03:07:26 having this going on right now.
03:07:27 An incredible waste of time
03:07:28 considering all that's on the
03:07:30 plate of this city.
03:07:30 And as others have mentioned,
03:07:34 we I'll bet every single one of
03:07:35 us is horrified as we listen to
03:07:38 the radio every day about
03:07:38 what's going on in washington
03:07:41 about executive overreach,
03:07:42 about complete disintegration
03:07:45 of checks and balances before
03:07:46 our very eyes.
03:07:46 If you really feel differently,
03:07:49 show that san francisco can do
03:07:49 it differently.
03:07:52 And just on a final note, this
03:07:53 vote that you're going to cast
03:07:54 is going to be with you for the
03:07:56 rest of your lives.
03:07:57 >> it's going to be a prominent
03:07:58 vote and it's going to follow
03:08:00 you everywhere.
03:08:00 >> so don't think you're going
03:08:01 to close the door on it today
03:08:04 because it's not going to
03:08:04 happen.
03:08:05 >> thank you.
03:08:05 Thank you.
03:08:07 Tam buckner.
03:08:11 >> next speaker please vote
03:08:11 in afternoon.
03:08:12 >> my name is ping huang and I
03:08:15 moved to san francisco in 1979.
03:08:16 I lived in the sunset district
03:08:20 and currently live in district
03:08:20 one in outer richmond.
03:08:23 I speak against you guys
03:08:23 authorizing the removal of the
03:08:24 commissioner.
03:08:27 Many things have been said
03:08:28 about the commissioner and I'm
03:08:31 very impressed with what he has
03:08:31 done.
03:08:35 I wonder if if his real is his
03:08:39 real issue or the issue that
03:08:40 the mayor has with him is that
03:08:42 he is he's a known dissenter
03:08:46 and I say dissent is good the
03:08:47 right kind of dissent on behalf
03:08:50 of the right kinds of you know,
03:08:53 civil rights.
03:08:53 Those are those are important
03:08:54 dissents.
03:08:57 We have had many people in our
03:09:00 history who have who go down
03:09:01 in history because of dissent.
03:09:05 >> so if he is a dissenter,
03:09:08 more power to him.
03:09:11 I also want to note that I have
03:09:12 worked in the software industry
03:09:16 for many years and actually
03:09:16 in my most recent ten years or
03:09:19 so I've worked on collaboration
03:09:20 ,software and collaboration is
03:09:24 his warm fuzzy word.
03:09:24 >> and I'm very disappointed
03:09:25 when it gets used in politics
03:09:28 like this.
03:09:28 People don't really know what
03:09:32 they want to say so they say oh
03:09:32 collaboration we want more
03:09:33 collaboration.
03:09:33 More collaboration is good.
03:09:36 I say dissent is the right
03:09:37 thing from people especially
03:09:40 people on an independent
03:09:41 commission who is supposed to
03:09:44 hold oversight over a powerful
03:09:47 source force like the police.
03:09:48 >> I also want to point out
03:09:52 that if you were in world war
03:09:55 two france to be a collaborator
03:09:56 is not exactly a compliment.
03:09:59 So I ask what kind of
03:09:59 collaboration is mayor lori
03:10:00 looking for?
03:10:03 What kind of collaboration is
03:10:04 he looking for from you guys as
03:10:04 a board of supervisors?
03:10:06 What kind of collaborator do
03:10:07 you want to be?
03:10:07 >> thank you.
03:10:10 thank you for your comments.
03:10:14 >> next speaker welcome.
03:10:15 >> hi, my name is norman
03:10:18 dahlmann and I'm a long time
03:10:19 resident of san francisco.
03:10:22 I support max carter opus stone
03:10:25 and I believe he is a very
03:10:28 important independent voice on
03:10:29 the commission.
03:10:29 >> thank you.
03:10:33 Thank you for your comments.
03:10:33 >> welcome.
03:10:36 Hello.
03:10:37 >> my name is sherril thornton
03:10:40 and I'm the co-chair of the
03:10:41 harriet tubman african-american
03:10:43 democratic club, the only black
03:10:44 democratic club here in san
03:10:44 francisco.
03:10:44 That's charter.
03:10:47 I strongly oppose the removal
03:10:48 of police commissioner max
03:10:52 aubusson a move that threatens
03:10:52 the independence and
03:10:55 accountability of police
03:10:55 commission.
03:10:56 Commissioner carter aubusson
03:10:58 has led critical reforms
03:10:59 including any pretext stops
03:11:02 that disproportionately target
03:11:03 black and brown communities.
03:11:06 He's worked on.
03:11:06 He's worked to hold san
03:11:09 francisco speedy accountable
03:11:10 way advancing policies that
03:11:11 improve public safety.
03:11:13 His removal is not about better
03:11:14 governance.
03:11:17 It's about silencing
03:11:18 independents in oversight.
03:11:22 >> quote supervisor matt dorsey
03:11:23 recently stated that the police
03:11:26 commission served at the
03:11:26 pleasure of the mayor.
03:11:27 >> but that is not how
03:11:30 independent oversight should
03:11:30 work.
03:11:34 This police commission exists
03:11:34 to hold law enforcement
03:11:35 accountable to the people not
03:11:39 to act as an extension of the
03:11:39 mayor's political agenda.
03:11:43 If commissioners are removed
03:11:46 for doing their jobs for too
03:11:46 well, police accountability
03:11:47 becomes nothing more than a
03:11:50 political tool.
03:11:51 >> and let's be clear this is
03:11:55 trump style politics.
03:11:58 Silencing reform can
03:11:59 consolidating power and
03:12:00 weakening oversight.
03:12:02 It's shameful that this is
03:12:03 happening during black history
03:12:06 month at a time when we should
03:12:07 be honoring the fight for
03:12:10 justice and not rolling it back
03:12:10 .
03:12:11 I also want to uplift
03:12:12 supervisors jackie fielder and
03:12:14 myrna melgar for standing
03:12:15 strong on this issue.
03:12:18 Their leadership reflects the
03:12:19 values that san francisco must
03:12:19 protect.
03:12:22 This is not about mayor lori.
03:12:22 It's about the people.
03:12:25 San francisco must remain
03:12:26 committed to justice, fairness
03:12:26 and real public safety.
03:12:29 Vote no.
03:12:29 I'm matt carter.
03:12:33 I was still in the removal.
03:12:33 >> thank you.
03:12:36 And power to the people.
03:12:37 >> thank you.
03:12:40 Sherril thornton.
03:12:41 >> next week is your history.
03:12:44 You're doomed to repeat it.
03:12:45 Hello, supervisors.
03:12:48 Some of you I have met with
03:12:49 in my advocacy work.
03:12:49 Hello.
03:12:49 Matt dorsey.
03:12:53 Hello, shimon waltz in and
03:12:54 hello MISS Connie shine the
03:12:56 rest of you I would love to me
03:12:57 some of you MAY or MAY not know
03:13:00 my story.
03:13:01 My name is christiana porter, a
03:13:04 very recent victim of excessive
03:13:05 force and police brutality
03:13:08 in san francisco.
03:13:09 As I stand here today, my right
03:13:12 arm is going down and tingling
03:13:13 with pain in the back of my
03:13:14 head due to that incident on
03:13:16 JULY 29th.
03:13:17 However, it's very important
03:13:21 for me to be here as I am a
03:13:23 resilient black mother of five
03:13:24 who needs her voice to be
03:13:24 heard.
03:13:28 >> it is very disrespectful and
03:13:31 a slap to my face that san
03:13:32 francisco not only is trying to
03:13:35 remove MR. Max carter from
03:13:39 creating the police seat that
03:13:40 caused me to get brutalized
03:13:43 which is that pretextual their
03:13:44 pretextual stop A.K.A. Stop and
03:13:47 frisk need I remind the room at
03:13:49 the central park five sandra
03:13:53 bland victims are pretextual
03:13:54 stops that should never have
03:13:54 happened.
03:13:57 >> with that being said, MR.
03:13:58 Max carter is being asked to
03:14:02 resign simply for having an
03:14:02 opposition oppositional
03:14:06 personality.
03:14:07 Isn't it a beautiful thing to
03:14:10 agree to disagree and come to
03:14:10 terms in middle ground?
03:14:11 That is the beauty of freedom
03:14:14 of speech.
03:14:15 That is why we are all able to
03:14:17 be here today and say our piece
03:14:17 right?
03:14:18 >> so in particular I won't
03:14:21 take up too much time.
03:14:22 However, I will say and end on
03:14:22 this note.
03:14:25 My people please understand
03:14:26 this and please be discerned
03:14:28 and watch body language.
03:14:29 They do not care about us.
03:14:32 It is time for us to care about
03:14:33 us.
03:14:33 I have been saying this and i
03:14:36 will continue saying this.
03:14:37 It's time for us to heal one
03:14:39 another, protect one another,
03:14:40 uplift one another.
03:14:44 I am outside every day a victim
03:14:47 of police brutality by myself
03:14:48 and my family.
03:14:57 >> thank you for your comments
03:14:58 .
03:14:58 All right.
03:15:01 Thank you for your comments.
03:15:02 >> so let's hear from our next
03:15:02 speaker.
03:15:04 You ready to go?
03:15:08 >> come on up.
03:15:12 >> I'm joel franco and I'm not
03:15:13 a resident here in san
03:15:16 francisco but I am a supporter
03:15:17 of the residents here in san
03:15:19 francisco and I'm here to
03:15:20 oppose the removal of max
03:15:24 carter overton.
03:15:27 I am here to stand by him.
03:15:28 >> and from what I'm hearing
03:15:29 from these people, he seemed to
03:15:31 be a man with good leadership,
03:15:35 great morals and values.
03:15:36 And I have to say though that
03:15:40 he's the kind of person that
03:15:43 the people here need and then
03:15:44 if you're going to remove
03:15:47 somebody, remove somebody who
03:15:48 keeps proving over and over
03:15:51 again that he chooses they
03:15:52 choose themselves over the
03:15:55 people and who keeps continuing
03:15:58 to say eh, the people don't
03:15:58 matter.
03:15:59 I do.
03:16:02 And also somebody who's
03:16:05 apparently too scared to take
03:16:06 accountability for their own
03:16:09 wrongdoings.
03:16:12 >> but max apparently is here
03:16:13 and he's going to continue to
03:16:14 be here.
03:16:17 So I will have to say don't
03:16:17 remove max at all.
03:16:18 >> please at least have the
03:16:22 decency see the courage and the
03:16:25 common sense to vote no and
03:16:25 stand against the things that
03:16:29 will continue to cause a lot of
03:16:30 harm so that communities here
03:16:33 from all walks of life.
03:16:36 >> that's all I have to say.
03:16:37 >> thank you.
03:16:37 Thank you for your comments.
03:16:40 Welcome to our next speaker
03:16:41 tonight.
03:16:44 >> so with my son I wish he was
03:16:47 my son.
03:16:48 >> sir, my name is frank noto.
03:16:52 I'm here on behalf of stop
03:16:54 crime action and our 4500
03:16:54 members.
03:16:55 And I am here to support the
03:16:59 removal of the commissioner
03:17:02 because his failure to serve
03:17:03 the public and to protect the
03:17:06 public safety san francisco has
03:17:10 a shortage of five 200 to 600
03:17:10 police officers.
03:17:11 >> and there's a reason for
03:17:11 that.
03:17:14 And that reason is partially
03:17:16 because of the attitude of the
03:17:20 police commission.
03:17:24 >> I don't question the
03:17:25 commissioner's intelligence or
03:17:25 his dedication.
03:17:28 But we need to have a police
03:17:29 commission that will enforce
03:17:29 the law fairly.
03:17:32 The commissioner failed to do
03:17:34 that when he required the san
03:17:35 francisco police department to
03:17:36 ignore california laws on
03:17:39 traffic safety.
03:17:42 We need accountability.
03:17:43 I also question his
03:17:46 independence and his
03:17:46 collaborative attitude.
03:17:49 He's not independent of special
03:17:50 interests.
03:17:51 He failed to engage with
03:17:53 citizens across the city,
03:17:54 especially on the on the west
03:17:54 side.
03:17:58 Again, we need accountability.
03:17:59 you have the legal authority to
03:17:59 remove him.
03:18:02 I urge you to do so and do the
03:18:03 right thing.
03:18:03 >> thank you.
03:18:05 I thank you for coming down
03:18:06 this afternoon.
03:18:06 >> let's hear from our next
03:18:07 speaker.
03:18:09 Welcome carolyn.
03:18:09 >> thank you.
03:18:10 Good afternoon, supervisors.
03:18:13 My name is carolyn goosen and I
03:18:14 work with the public defender's
03:18:15 office as their san francisco
03:18:17 policy director.
03:18:17 And in this capacity I've had
03:18:18 the honor of working closely
03:18:21 with commissioner carter over
03:18:22 stone over the past three years
03:18:25 on the policy to limit racially
03:18:25 biased stops.
03:18:26 >> and I wanted to come today
03:18:28 to share my support and
03:18:29 appreciation for his tireless
03:18:32 work to make our city safer for
03:18:33 all san franciscans.
03:18:36 >> he has not only provided
03:18:37 critical, unwavering oversight
03:18:40 of our city's armed police
03:18:41 force but he has also fought
03:18:44 for S.F. Pd to engage
03:18:44 in policing that does not rely
03:18:45 on racial bias and police
03:18:48 violence.
03:18:49 >> as you are all well aware
03:18:49 supervisors, we give enormous
03:18:52 power to the police.
03:18:53 They can as part of their legal
03:18:56 duties carry weapons, detain
03:18:59 people even children lie to
03:19:00 coerce information.
03:19:01 >> and they can even legally
03:19:03 take someone's life.
03:19:04 With this amount of power we
03:19:07 need to ensure that there's
03:19:08 strong independent civilian
03:19:08 oversight.
03:19:11 And this is what commissioner
03:19:12 carter stone exemplifies.
03:19:15 i've had a chance to witness
03:19:16 personally max's policing
03:19:20 policy expertise and his
03:19:20 measured, thoughtful style.
03:19:23 >> time and time again
03:19:23 everything he has done on this
03:19:24 commission he has done using
03:19:27 data research and is done
03:19:30 in collaboration with S.F. Pd
03:19:30 staff, with expert and with
03:19:34 diverse san franciscans.
03:19:35 >> as was mentioned, he led on
03:19:38 the most collaborative policy
03:19:39 process the commissioner the
03:19:42 commission has ever seen.
03:19:42 >> we are very fortunate to
03:19:43 have someone like commissioner
03:19:47 carter ober stone sit as a
03:19:47 volunteer commissioner in the
03:19:48 city.
03:19:50 And I hope you will allow him
03:19:50 to continue in this role.
03:19:51 >> thank you.
03:19:54 Thank you for your comments.
03:19:57 >> welcome liam mcgeever hello.
03:20:02 >> so I woke up in 2020.
03:20:05 >> did you or were you just
03:20:06 faking it?
03:20:07 >> you know what I learned
03:20:08 in 2020 from the murder of
03:20:11 george floyd?
03:20:15 >> you always film the cops,
03:20:15 right?
03:20:16 >> I'm just going to film my
03:20:18 supervisor a little longer
03:20:22 because he's a big cop.
03:20:26 >> when you're being filmed,
03:20:30 when you're you know, having
03:20:30 someone look over your
03:20:31 shoulder, does that make you
03:20:34 feel a little different?
03:20:35 Like maybe you should behave a
03:20:41 little better.
03:20:45 >> we need that for the cops.
03:20:46 It is life and death and
03:20:49 there's a lot of death that
03:20:52 has gone on here.
03:20:53 And why aren't you interested
03:20:59 in stopping it?
03:21:00 >> I live in the heart of the
03:21:03 open air drug market.
03:21:03 I've lived there as a homeowner
03:21:06 for the past three years.
03:21:11 >> I have felt the ramp up of
03:21:14 policing in my neighborhood on
03:21:14 my front step.
03:21:18 >> and it's only gotten worse.
03:21:21 >> I am here to testify your
03:21:25 speedy answers don't work.
03:21:29 >> I want to defund the police
03:21:32 still I want to abolish the
03:21:33 police still okay.
03:21:34 >> I don't know what happens to
03:21:36 that sentiment.
03:21:37 It's only five years since
03:21:37 2020, right?
03:21:40 Was there a time machine?
03:21:41 >> are we like 100 years?
03:21:41 2020?
03:21:42 Like what the happened?
03:21:45 I'm glad people are realizing a
03:21:48 blue billionaire is just as
03:21:49 horrible as a red billionaire.
03:21:52 Okay.
03:21:53 There's no benevolent
03:21:53 billionaires.
03:21:56 Why does this billionaire ever
03:21:57 want to control us for a dollar
03:22:00 a year?
03:22:01 What is the rush to get rid of
03:22:01 police oversight?
03:22:04 I have seen what's happening on
03:22:07 six and ten.
03:22:11 >> thank you, leah and.
03:22:11 Thank you, leah.
03:22:20 Welcome to the next speaker.
03:22:21 As a frequent attendee of
03:22:22 police commission meetings I
03:22:25 have witnessed the commission's
03:22:25 operations firsthand and I have
03:22:29 often seen a routine pattern of
03:22:30 pushing personal agendas over
03:22:30 public will.
03:22:33 >> therefore I do support mayor
03:22:34 laurie's decision to remove
03:22:34 commissioner over stone.
03:22:37 Independence is good.
03:22:41 Oversight is necessary but
03:22:41 after sb 50 failed this
03:22:44 commissioners aggressive push
03:22:45 for digital 9.7 was right or
03:22:49 wrong.
03:22:50 In terms of pretext stops right
03:22:50 or wrong was his personal
03:22:53 crusade to implement
03:22:53 restrictions that both
03:22:54 california legislators and
03:22:56 voters have explicitly
03:22:57 rejected.
03:22:58 When state lawmakers declined
03:23:00 to enact something into law, it
03:23:01 is not appropriate for an
03:23:05 unelected commissioner to try
03:23:05 to force it through locally.
03:23:06 >> the city attorney's failure
03:23:08 to check these overreaches does
03:23:09 not make them legitimate.
03:23:09 It simply turns them into
03:23:12 costly litigation and future
03:23:12 ballot measures.
03:23:15 San francisco voters have
03:23:16 already attempted to course
03:23:16 correct this by voting
03:23:20 overwhelmingly by passing
03:23:21 proposition e because they
03:23:23 recognized how far the
03:23:24 commission's actions have
03:23:24 strayed from the parameters of
03:23:27 their charter commission over
03:23:28 stones removal is a crucial
03:23:29 step in realigning the police
03:23:31 commission with its intended
03:23:32 purpose by removing a
03:23:32 commissioner who consistently
03:23:35 pursued his personal agenda
03:23:35 over voter and legislative
03:23:36 intent.
03:23:39 This board acknowledges the
03:23:39 public's frustration with rogue
03:23:40 public officials and signals
03:23:43 its commitment to governing by
03:23:44 honest and democratic
03:23:44 principles.
03:23:47 >> when commissioners lose
03:23:48 sight of their role, disregard
03:23:49 voter will and attempt to
03:23:52 circumvent state law removal is
03:23:55 essential and appropriate.
03:23:56 It is incumbent upon this board
03:23:56 to do it.
03:23:59 removing max carter over stone
03:24:00 from his seat that he is using
03:24:03 for his own personal agenda and
03:24:04 I go to all the meetings is a
03:24:07 tremendous cause correction
03:24:07 towards public safety and
03:24:08 reestablishing trust in our
03:24:11 commission.
03:24:11 >> thank you.
03:24:14 I'd like the members of the
03:24:15 public please allow each
03:24:15 speaker to have their two
03:24:18 minutes please.
03:24:18 No interrupting.
03:24:19 Please.
03:24:22 Please proceed, ma'am.
03:24:23 >> hello?
03:24:23 Members of the board of
03:24:24 supervisors.
03:24:26 My name is angela chan.
03:24:27 I'm an assistant chief attorney
03:24:27 at the san francisco public
03:24:29 defender's office.
03:24:30 >> I'm also a former member of
03:24:31 the police commission.
03:24:33 Today you'll make a decision
03:24:34 that impacts public safety for
03:24:34 san franciscans.
03:24:37 >> no other entity in san
03:24:38 francisco has the same power as
03:24:41 law enforcement to build a
03:24:41 wield state violence to take
03:24:42 away your freedom and even your
03:24:42 life.
03:24:45 With that power I hope we can
03:24:46 all agree there has to be
03:24:49 rigorous independent oversight
03:24:49 by civilians to ensure that
03:24:52 police do not abuse it.
03:24:53 That is a system that san
03:24:54 francisco voters installed
03:24:57 decades ago and this is a
03:24:57 system that voters have
03:24:58 recently reaffirmed by
03:25:01 rejecting a ballot measure that
03:25:01 would have gutted this police
03:25:02 commission.
03:25:05 >> as a former member of the
03:25:06 commission who has seen the
03:25:07 inner workings of the police
03:25:09 department including the
03:25:09 serious and in some cases
03:25:12 violent misconduct committed by
03:25:13 some officers, I know what is
03:25:13 at stake.
03:25:17 We do not need more
03:25:17 commissioners.
03:25:18 >> commissioners who are former
03:25:21 or current prosecute ers who
03:25:22 are already too close to the
03:25:24 police to be independent.
03:25:25 >> we don't need more
03:25:26 commissioners who rubber stamp
03:25:29 and look the other way when
03:25:29 there's racial disparity,
03:25:32 misconduct and excessive force.
03:25:33 >> I've seen that too much on
03:25:36 the police commission but we
03:25:36 need our commissioners like max
03:25:37 carter overton who who's unlike
03:25:40 any mayor appointee I've ever
03:25:41 met and I mean that I've met a
03:25:41 lot.
03:25:44 >> he provides painstaking,
03:25:44 unbiased and thoughtful
03:25:45 oversight.
03:25:48 He deeply cares about community
03:25:49 safety and ensuring that police
03:25:50 are not disproportionately
03:25:51 stopping and traumatizing black
03:25:54 and brown communities.
03:25:55 >> he's a subject matter
03:25:55 expert.
03:25:58 There are not that many subject
03:25:59 matter experts I've seen on
03:26:02 this commission who's worked on
03:26:05 police reform prior to joining
03:26:06 the commission and most
03:26:07 importantly he is not afraid to
03:26:09 speak truth to power.
03:26:10 He's not afraid to whistle
03:26:10 blowing.
03:26:13 He knows something is wrong and
03:26:16 something is unjust with black
03:26:17 and brown lives on the line her
03:26:18 the most vulnerable, the
03:26:21 policeman's conduct we need
03:26:21 more serious smart and caring
03:26:25 commissioners like carter over
03:26:25 stone.
03:26:25 you heard his story.
03:26:29 He does this from his heart.
03:26:29 >> yeah.
03:26:30 Thank you.
03:26:33 Dedication.
03:26:34 I urge you to try to do the
03:26:37 right thing and save filner.
03:26:37 >> it's hard to know.
03:26:42 Thank you for your comments.
03:26:42 >> all right.
03:26:43 We're asking you to hold your
03:26:44 applause, everyone.
03:26:48 Next speaker, please.
03:26:49 Supervisors.
03:26:49 My name is zach dillon.
03:26:52 I'm a policy analyst for public
03:26:53 defender's office.
03:26:53 And I worry your minds are
03:26:56 already made up.
03:26:56 So most of my comments are to
03:26:57 be addressed to the people who
03:26:59 came out in support today.
03:27:03 >> I want to thank everyone for
03:27:04 coming out and supporting.
03:27:05 >> I think it's important not
03:27:06 only to show our support to the
03:27:08 work that max did while he was
03:27:09 a commissioner and while he has
03:27:11 been a question and hopefully
03:27:12 will continue to be a
03:27:13 commissioner but to anyone
03:27:13 who's appointed to this
03:27:15 commission the future should
03:27:16 also know that the community
03:27:19 members and advocates will have
03:27:20 their back and will support
03:27:20 them when they're doing the
03:27:22 work that needs to get done.
03:27:23 >> max didn't always do what I
03:27:24 wanted him to do.
03:27:27 I have a public defenders lens
03:27:28 on things just as I know he
03:27:31 didn't always do what the chief
03:27:31 of police or former mayor
03:27:32 wanted but he always explained
03:27:34 his thinking publicly and got
03:27:35 consensus on the commission for
03:27:38 some pretty contentious issues
03:27:38 .
03:27:39 The pretext policy he
03:27:39 shepherded along did not
03:27:42 include everything I advocated
03:27:42 for in the working group
03:27:43 meetings.
03:27:44 It didn't even include
03:27:45 everything from the first
03:27:45 published draft.
03:27:46 >> but the compromise he
03:27:49 reached was based on the
03:27:49 information available and it is
03:27:53 why it ended up passing
03:27:53 unanimously from the commission
03:27:54 and with the support of more
03:27:56 than 100 organization in the
03:27:57 city.
03:28:00 >> I do worry about the future
03:28:00 of the department without the
03:28:04 doj oversight and now with the
03:28:04 threat of losing a key voice
03:28:08 asking questions and probing
03:28:08 the edges of policies, will we
03:28:11 return to an era of police
03:28:12 setting their own policy on car
03:28:15 chases, police shootings,
03:28:15 racial profiling no knock
03:28:16 warrants at times going to have
03:28:18 to tell.
03:28:19 >> I was hoping that the mayor
03:28:23 would actually reappoint max to
03:28:24 a new term next APRIL which
03:28:25 whether he wants that or not I
03:28:26 don't know.
03:28:27 But if he doesn't, this board
03:28:28 should appoint max to a term.
03:28:31 The next time a commissioner's
03:28:32 seat comes up from this board.
03:28:34 >> thank you.
03:28:35 >> thank you for your comments.
03:28:38 Hold your applause, everyone
03:28:39 please.
03:28:39 >> next speaker.
03:28:40 Hello, board.
03:28:42 My name is griffin lee d2
03:28:43 resident and I'm here to
03:28:46 support their larry and the
03:28:47 removal and firing of max
03:28:50 carter over stone master as a
03:28:53 leader to the 9.07 which
03:28:57 limited our ability meaning the
03:28:58 police department's ability to
03:29:01 to do traffic enforcement since
03:29:04 diego 9.7 was accepted and if
03:29:05 negatively affected morale of
03:29:08 the police department because
03:29:09 it's another dojo to think
03:29:10 about when they're behind a car
03:29:13 that MAY have expired tags no
03:29:17 front license plate and stuff
03:29:20 of that nature in my and their
03:29:21 observation and this is coming
03:29:22 from a police officer I met
03:29:25 yesterday because of this
03:29:25 confusion.
03:29:28 Cops do way less traffic
03:29:29 enforcement which led to more
03:29:32 unsafe driving from the general
03:29:32 public.
03:29:33 Additionally, the acceptance of
03:29:35 the dijo has discouraged
03:29:36 proactive police work meaning
03:29:37 there is less traffic stop
03:29:39 traffic for someone over and
03:29:40 sees guns and drugs that are
03:29:43 killing us on our streets today
03:29:44 and people with arrest warrants
03:29:47 and cool stuff like that.
03:29:50 >> again I'm in support of
03:29:50 mayor lori and I highly
03:29:54 encourage you to vote on the
03:29:55 removal of max carter over
03:29:56 stone thank you.
03:29:58 >> thank you for your comments.
03:30:01 Nick speaker please.
03:30:02 >> hi, my name is brad chapman.
03:30:04 I'm one of the vice presidents
03:30:05 of the harvey milk democratic
03:30:06 club.
03:30:06 I want to thank supervisor
03:30:08 fielder and melgar for your
03:30:15 courage and I'm really feeling
03:30:16 anxious about this because I
03:30:17 know some folks on this board
03:30:19 and I don't really like to put
03:30:20 myself out there when I was
03:30:21 reading I mean I do I've done
03:30:23 it too much in the past and I
03:30:24 kind of want to get away from
03:30:24 that.
03:30:27 But when I was reading this to
03:30:27 my boyfriend he was like do you
03:30:28 want to put a target on your
03:30:29 back?
03:30:33 >> and here I go.
03:30:33 So here's some quotes.
03:30:34 A system that rewards
03:30:37 corruption that's what we have.
03:30:38 It's time to turn the page on
03:30:41 corruption in san francisco.
03:30:42 Our residents and taxpayers
03:30:43 deserve accountable effective
03:30:43 leadership.
03:30:46 No more backroom deals,
03:30:46 conflicts of interests or
03:30:47 broken promises.
03:30:49 We cannot continue to do the
03:30:50 things the same way they've
03:30:53 been done because we're going
03:30:54 to get the same results.
03:30:54 You can't solve the problem
03:30:57 when you are part of the
03:30:58 problem.
03:31:00 >> those are all daniel lurie
03:31:04 we all know we all know that
03:31:05 this vote is at its core about
03:31:06 taking power from someone who
03:31:08 put truth to power by a board
03:31:09 that is afraid to hold its
03:31:12 mayor accountable after so many
03:31:13 bridges were burnt with the
03:31:13 last one.
03:31:15 We all know that most of our
03:31:16 supervisors made up their minds
03:31:17 about how they'll vote on this
03:31:20 hearing before they heard us
03:31:20 speak today.
03:31:21 Are you going to be a part of
03:31:24 the problem or are you going to
03:31:25 be a part of the solution and
03:31:28 do our voices matter when
03:31:28 politicians and leaders
03:31:31 oversimplify, deny or exploit
03:31:32 public health crises?
03:31:35 Dorsey in the name of public
03:31:36 safety for personal gain
03:31:36 everyone loses.
03:31:39 You're a former spokesman
03:31:40 in dorsey for a police
03:31:41 department protected by the
03:31:43 power that unlimited power and
03:31:44 absolute immunity for police
03:31:45 officers should you recuse
03:31:48 yourself from this for comments
03:31:51 to the board as a whole as
03:31:51 well?
03:31:51 Okay.
03:31:55 Well harry to those folks on
03:31:56 this board who knew him
03:31:58 believed that tepid liberalism
03:31:59 kept those who are powerful
03:32:00 satisfied with the status quo
03:32:03 and that none of us should rest
03:32:04 until there is a fundamental
03:32:06 transfer of that power to and
03:32:11 people power and thank you
03:32:11 thank you for your comments.
03:32:14 >> if you'd like to provide is
03:32:15 a copy of that we can include
03:32:15 it in the minutes.
03:32:20 >> welcome to the next speaker
03:32:20 .
03:32:21 >> good afternoon everybody.
03:32:25 My name is justice doom la.
03:32:26 I'm here on behalf of treatment
03:32:26 on demand and safer inside
03:32:28 coalitions.
03:32:32 I'm here to ensure that you all
03:32:36 here once again MARCH quarter
03:32:36 over sound deserves to stay and
03:32:39 finish this term on the police
03:32:40 commission.
03:32:40 >> I don't think I need to
03:32:44 reiterate all of his incredible
03:32:44 accomplishments and attitude
03:32:47 and work that he does on the
03:32:47 commission.
03:32:50 >> but might I remind you all
03:32:51 that most of you voted to give
03:32:55 more power to the mayor?
03:32:55 And it seems like you're ready
03:32:58 to hand over yet again more
03:32:59 power to this new mayor who has
03:33:03 little to no bureaucratic
03:33:06 experience.
03:33:07 And so I just want to warn you
03:33:10 all that you have a job to do.
03:33:13 And I hope that you continue to
03:33:14 do that.
03:33:14 Weakening the police commission
03:33:18 is not going to help us solve
03:33:19 any of the other issues in san
03:33:19 francisco.
03:33:22 We cannot arrest our way out of
03:33:25 an overdose epidemic.
03:33:29 >> please keep max carter over
03:33:30 soon on the police commission.
03:33:30 >> thank you.
03:33:31 Thank you for your comments.
03:33:33 Welcome to the next speaker.
03:33:34 >> thank you.
03:33:37 My name is tyler.
03:33:38 >> I live in district five.
03:33:41 I usually hate to compare
03:33:41 people to donald trump.
03:33:44 I think it's kind of easy and
03:33:45 lazy but like let's look at
03:33:46 what's happening, right?
03:33:48 We have an executive trying to
03:33:49 get rid of someone who's in a
03:33:50 key oversight role.
03:33:52 He hasn't even really given a
03:33:53 reason as far as I know.
03:33:56 Is anyone here from the mayor's
03:33:57 office?
03:33:57 I don't think so.
03:33:57 Right.
03:33:59 He's not come to this meeting
03:34:00 or sent someone to this meeting
03:34:04 to justify this.
03:34:05 And he's acting like we should
03:34:05 just go along with it and that
03:34:07 the board should just go along
03:34:08 with it and just let him do it
03:34:11 without asking any questions
03:34:11 and he's acting like it's his
03:34:12 commission, that it's the
03:34:15 mayors police commission.
03:34:16 It's not it's supposed to be an
03:34:18 independent commission as
03:34:19 commissioner cartier-bresson
03:34:20 said at the beginning.
03:34:23 >> so you tell me if the
03:34:23 comparison with trump makes
03:34:24 sense.
03:34:26 Thank you.
03:34:27 >> thank you for your comments.
03:34:29 Next speaker welcome.
03:34:30 >> thank you.
03:34:30 Good afternoon.
03:34:33 Board of supervisors.
03:34:34 My name is brian cox and I'm
03:34:35 here with the public defender's
03:34:37 office.
03:34:38 S.F. Has a long documented
03:34:42 history of sidelining and
03:34:42 silencing outspoken critics of
03:34:45 the police whether they are
03:34:48 outspoken policy advocates and
03:34:49 those within the department
03:34:49 itself or outspoken
03:34:52 commissioners like max.
03:34:53 Outside legacy continues today
03:34:56 with this sham vote to remove
03:34:57 him.
03:34:57 As I wrote in my letter last
03:35:00 week opposing his removal, max
03:35:01 is eminently qualified to
03:35:02 continue his work at the
03:35:04 commission.
03:35:05 Not only does he deserve to
03:35:06 finish this term but he
03:35:08 deserves another term.
03:35:12 >> his resume is seriously
03:35:12 impressive.
03:35:13 His credentials are impeccable
03:35:15 and his worth work ethic is
03:35:16 relentless.
03:35:16 No one has advanced any
03:35:19 arguments in public to remove
03:35:23 him only baseless speculation
03:35:24 and obeisance supports this
03:35:27 vote and that it is directed at
03:35:28 a black commissioner during
03:35:31 black history month is a stain
03:35:31 on this spine institution.
03:35:34 Shame.
03:35:35 >> in his role max has relied
03:35:38 on best practices, research
03:35:38 data, community input and
03:35:42 feedback from officers to form
03:35:42 his opinions.
03:35:45 That's what we want in a
03:35:46 commissioner and his list of
03:35:49 accomplishments in his short
03:35:50 term or seriously impressive.
03:35:53 And as others have noted I
03:35:54 won't go through them again.
03:35:54 But what strikes me as obvious
03:35:57 is that he has been consistent
03:35:57 and calling out the department
03:35:58 when it overstepped its bounds.
03:36:01 that's accountability.
03:36:01 That's the job.
03:36:05 And that's what he has done.
03:36:06 His northstar has always been
03:36:09 about asking the hard
03:36:09 questions.
03:36:10 The others are too afraid or
03:36:12 too comfortable to ask.
03:36:13 He's always followed his
03:36:16 conscience and we need that.
03:36:17 We need that from not just him
03:36:19 but from every other
03:36:20 commissioner to hold the
03:36:21 department and its officers
03:36:21 accountable.
03:36:23 Make no mistake what's at
03:36:23 stake.
03:36:27 This vote is really about the
03:36:28 future of police accountability
03:36:30 and transparency and oversight
03:36:31 in san francisco.
03:36:34 Every action that happens that
03:36:34 weakens transparency and
03:36:35 accountability and
03:36:35 accountability moving forward
03:36:38 because of this vote you'll
03:36:39 have to live with that.
03:36:42 >> thank you ryan dodson for
03:36:45 your comments.
03:36:50 Next week please and afternoon
03:36:50 supervisors.
03:36:53 My name is tess wellborn.
03:36:53 >> district five.
03:36:57 I'd like to address I'd like to
03:37:03 address two points.
03:37:04 >> the police commission
03:37:04 doesn't control the police
03:37:07 department.
03:37:09 >> if their closure rate is one
03:37:10 of the lowest in the nation,
03:37:11 almost every police department
03:37:14 across the nation is short of
03:37:14 officers.
03:37:16 Maybe it's time to think about
03:37:20 some other approaches.
03:37:21 >> I think that we are just
03:37:25 incredibly lucky to have
03:37:28 someone who with the expertise
03:37:32 of carter over stone and I
03:37:33 would think that we have to
03:37:36 keep him.
03:37:47 Let's see if you think that it
03:37:48 is good to replace somebody for
03:37:51 no good reason that has been
03:37:51 given.
03:37:52 No malfeasance.
03:37:55 No other crime.
03:37:55 >> no crime.
03:37:59 I'd like you to think about the
03:37:59 the parallels with trump.
03:38:00 Yes, but I'd also like you to
03:38:03 think about okay, who will be
03:38:03 next?
03:38:06 Who else will the mayor say?
03:38:07 Well, you were elected for a
03:38:10 term but forget that.
03:38:11 >> so what's the point of
03:38:14 having terms?
03:38:14 >> completely.
03:38:21 It's time to say that whatever
03:38:25 happens now could be a
03:38:28 precedent for future mayors
03:38:29 future and as well as the
03:38:29 current mayor.
03:38:32 And I think we've got to follow
03:38:33 a little bit of the rule of law
03:38:33 here.
03:38:36 You know, just a tiny bit and
03:38:39 keep this great man.
03:38:40 >> thank you.
03:38:41 Thank you for your comments.
03:38:46 Welcome to the next speaker.
03:38:47 >> good afternoon, san
03:38:47 francisco.
03:38:48 My name is starchild.
03:38:50 I'm chair of the libertarian
03:38:51 party of san francisco and here
03:38:52 on behalf of our over 3000
03:38:55 registered libertarians in san
03:38:56 francisco to support keeping
03:38:59 max carter over stone on the
03:38:59 police commission.
03:39:02 Libertarians strongly believe
03:39:03 in not only fiscal
03:39:03 responsibility and limited but
03:39:06 limited across the board civil
03:39:10 liberties vitally important.
03:39:11 I've been moved by many of the
03:39:13 comments here today and it does
03:39:14 just back my mind again and
03:39:16 again how just five years ago
03:39:20 in the wake of george floyd's
03:39:20 murder by police, people are
03:39:23 falling over themselves to talk
03:39:24 about police accountability and
03:39:25 the need to defund the police
03:39:28 and some people even talking
03:39:29 about the need to abolish the
03:39:30 police which are not part of
03:39:32 america's original heritage.
03:39:32 There were no police back
03:39:35 in the days of the founders and
03:39:39 we don't need an armed standing
03:39:43 army that they were concerned
03:39:43 about trying to control every
03:39:46 aspect of our lives.
03:39:47 And each one of you when you
03:39:47 pass laws you have to realize
03:39:49 what the law is.
03:39:53 It's basically an authorization
03:39:53 for those uniformed individuals
03:39:57 carrying guns to use as much
03:39:58 force as necessary to get
03:40:01 people to comply with it up to
03:40:02 and including shooting and
03:40:04 killing them if they resist.
03:40:09 So if you don't exercise proper
03:40:12 control over the police in your
03:40:16 oversight capacity including
03:40:16 keeping a strong police
03:40:17 commission which really should
03:40:19 be elected not appointed, you
03:40:20 will have blood on your hands
03:40:23 the next time there's a sheila
03:40:27 de toi or a mario woods or a
03:40:28 pat on gore or an alex nieto or
03:40:30 all the other victims of police
03:40:33 abuse and killing that if seen
03:40:37 here in our city.
03:40:38 And think about this and think
03:40:40 about executive overreach.
03:40:41 You see what's going on with
03:40:42 donald trump rallies san
03:40:43 francisco we have too much of a
03:40:45 strong mayor system where the
03:40:45 voters did say no to property
03:40:49 and there are limits and the
03:40:50 pendulum is going to swing
03:40:50 back.
03:40:51 And if you vote for his removal
03:40:55 today, many of you will be.
03:40:56 >> thank you, starchild.
03:40:56 Thank you.
03:40:59 Welcome to the next speaker.
03:40:59 >> hi.
03:41:03 My name is mario lemus.
03:41:07 I am a long term resident of
03:41:07 san francisco.
03:41:10 I took the afternoon off.
03:41:11 I hate politics.
03:41:12 I mean the backdoor dealings
03:41:14 and all that stuff is just
03:41:15 something I see a lot of people
03:41:16 glazing over here especially
03:41:18 shaman.
03:41:22 And you know for me as a
03:41:23 resident and marching in act up
03:41:25 in the 80s as a man to be here
03:41:28 this is unprecedented.
03:41:29 I mean it's it's kind of scary
03:41:30 to see that somebody is being
03:41:33 pushed out for no reason
03:41:33 whatsoever.
03:41:37 And for it seems like some of
03:41:38 you have already made up your
03:41:41 minds and taking a lot of
03:41:41 breaks and moving through.
03:41:44 And it's really terrible to see
03:41:45 it.
03:41:48 So you know, it it it's
03:41:48 disheartening to see so many
03:41:52 people coming here taking their
03:41:52 time off in in hopes that you
03:41:56 would keep max here to stay on
03:41:56 the commission.
03:41:59 I urge you to think think
03:42:00 properly because this is
03:42:00 dangerous.
03:42:03 It's going to be passed.
03:42:04 >> thank you for your comments
03:42:07 already.
03:42:08 >> decision.
03:42:08 Welcome back.
03:42:09 Former member of the board john
03:42:11 avalos good afternoon
03:42:15 supervisors as a member of the
03:42:16 board I actually rarely use
03:42:19 talking points but I need to be
03:42:20 more precise now this moment
03:42:23 demands real leadership that
03:42:24 unite san francisco for the
03:42:26 good of all not by imposing a
03:42:27 singular single point of view
03:42:30 and conditioning goodwill to
03:42:31 those of you who vote the right
03:42:31 way.
03:42:34 Leadership is doing the hard
03:42:34 work of building consensus
03:42:35 across differences.
03:42:38 True leadership means
03:42:39 assembling a team of rivals
03:42:39 practicing diplomacy and
03:42:42 governing the entire city not
03:42:43 just with the people who agree
03:42:46 with your point of view.
03:42:47 At the national level we face
03:42:50 an existential crisis.
03:42:51 Trump's executive orders amount
03:42:54 to a coup with mass firings of
03:42:55 federal workers and the
03:42:56 empowerment of public funds
03:42:58 being used to extort state and
03:42:59 local governments into
03:42:59 submission.
03:43:02 San francisco must decide
03:43:03 whether it will stand firm or
03:43:05 fall in line.
03:43:06 We will start practice the same
03:43:09 kind of leadership as
03:43:09 supervisors.
03:43:10 You are often forced into false
03:43:13 choices.
03:43:14 Sometimes it feels like a ton
03:43:14 of bricks hangs over your head.
03:43:17 But this vote is a voluntary
03:43:19 one and one that one.
03:43:20 It's not one of those town of
03:43:23 brick moments.
03:43:24 You shouldn't have to vote on
03:43:27 this at all if it is a forced
03:43:28 vote then our city has already
03:43:31 stumbled under new leadership.
03:43:31 Supervisors the public needs
03:43:32 the best of you.
03:43:36 We hope you can provide us with
03:43:36 transparency and operate with
03:43:39 the highest ethical standards
03:43:40 and not just toe the line of
03:43:42 what is acceptable.
03:43:43 If the mayor has truly shared
03:43:44 with you the reason he wishes
03:43:47 to remove mac's commissioner
03:43:48 max carter oberstar then and
03:43:50 you agree with it the public
03:43:51 deserves to hear it and
03:43:51 understand it.
03:43:54 If not, this vote will be seen
03:43:55 for what it is a course of
03:43:58 political act and stumbled
03:43:59 unaccountable leadership at a
03:44:02 time when compliance with the
03:44:03 federal means storing
03:44:03 immigrants and transgender
03:44:06 family members under the bus.
03:44:07 We should not be practicing
03:44:10 that kind of leadership in the
03:44:11 city of st francis.
03:44:11 I urge you to reject the
03:44:14 removal of congressional
03:44:15 commissioner carter oberstar
03:44:15 oberstar.
03:44:16 Thank you.
03:44:20 >> thank you for your comments
03:44:21 ,MR. Toronto.
03:44:21 >> hi.
03:44:24 Good afternoon, MR. Barry
03:44:24 toronto.
03:44:25 I came here on another matter
03:44:28 but I felt after watching
03:44:28 everything.
03:44:29 >> I'm concerned about the
03:44:31 precedent being setting here.
03:44:32 >> first the clerk's office
03:44:36 taught me how to say his name.
03:44:36 Max carter overtown.
03:44:40 So that took a while to figure
03:44:40 out.
03:44:44 So now you figure out that this
03:44:44 is a precedent you're setting
03:44:48 by by removing a commissioner
03:44:49 who is appointed to serve out a
03:44:49 term and hasn't committed a
03:44:52 crime and hasn't done anything
03:44:56 that that requires this type of
03:44:56 level of attention.
03:44:59 So you're bringing attention to
03:44:59 yourselves.
03:45:00 You're bringing attention to
03:45:03 the fact that that the that the
03:45:03 disenfranchized communities of
03:45:06 color and lower income
03:45:07 communities are not really
03:45:10 fairly represented in certain
03:45:10 city commissions.
03:45:14 And you've already given the
03:45:15 the mayor a lot of of of of
03:45:18 leeway and on certain topics
03:45:19 and certain areas to solve
03:45:22 certain problems.
03:45:23 >> so now you want to remove
03:45:26 somebody who actually feels
03:45:30 represented in judaism.
03:45:31 So the social justice aspect of
03:45:34 it is tikkun olam, tikkun olam.
03:45:38 Look it up and I feel that by
03:45:38 not by bye bye.
03:45:42 By accepting the mayor's
03:45:45 decision here you are actually
03:45:46 going the opposite of tikkun
03:45:46 olam and you are going to
03:45:49 create more turmoil and
03:45:50 in these communities by by
03:45:53 already the mayor bombarded by
03:45:54 the mayor's request at this
03:45:57 point I'm saying there there is
03:45:58 a request for you to appoint
03:46:01 alphonso felder to the to the
03:46:05 mta board and he's a good guy.
03:46:06 I worked with him when they
03:46:06 planned out that they have
03:46:08 traffic and transportation
03:46:09 around oracle park which was
03:46:12 which was pac bell at the time
03:46:12 .
03:46:13 He's a good guy.
03:46:14 But the thing is is that is
03:46:16 that is replacing a vacancy and
03:46:17 we're not replacing a vacancy
03:46:19 here.
03:46:20 We're letting someone serve out
03:46:21 their term who represents
03:46:24 people who don't feel
03:46:24 represented.
03:46:24 >> thank you.
03:46:27 Thank you barry for all right,
03:46:28 everyone hold your comments.
03:46:31 >> welcome.
03:46:32 >> good afternoon everyone.
03:46:35 My name is chemistry.
03:46:35 My office and I pretty much
03:46:39 consider myself resigned from
03:46:42 public speaking in public life
03:46:42 .
03:46:43 But I was at home in the middle
03:46:46 of a final exam and because I
03:46:50 love education and listening to
03:46:53 this meeting and I had to get
03:46:56 up and do a few things number
03:46:57 one just put on some different
03:46:59 clothes.
03:47:03 And number two, going print out
03:47:07 something and look up a date
03:47:08 NOVEMBER 5th, 2003 when the
03:47:11 citizens of san francisco
03:47:11 passed proposition eight the
03:47:15 police reform measure which
03:47:18 really targeted the idea that
03:47:23 the mayor could just remove
03:47:23 someone on the police
03:47:26 commission because somehow the
03:47:30 way they were deciding things
03:47:34 didn't go as supposedly planned
03:47:35 or the board of supervisors
03:47:36 could just remove someone from
03:47:38 a commission, particularly the
03:47:41 police commission without any
03:47:42 justification.
03:47:46 >> citizens of san francisco
03:47:49 for that reason they became so
03:47:50 such a big deal because there
03:47:50 was also this thing called
03:47:51 fajita gate.
03:47:53 You can go look that up and
03:47:54 there was also the thurgood
03:47:57 marshall police riot and I was
03:48:01 the ptsa PRESIDENT Of that high
03:48:01 school when that happened and
03:48:05 it was tragic and there are
03:48:06 many things that have been
03:48:09 tragic but we made certain that
03:48:10 we passed that so these kinds
03:48:13 of things wouldn't happen.
03:48:14 And I came to speak to you just
03:48:17 to remind you if you didn't
03:48:20 know that there is still an
03:48:21 audience for this city now so
03:48:24 somehow maybe you didn't read
03:48:25 it but it was specific.
03:48:28 >> so this couldn't happen.
03:48:32 And so if you're doing this it
03:48:32 goes against that ordinance
03:48:33 that exists here in san
03:48:37 francisco and I don't think you
03:48:38 want to do that not as duly
03:48:39 elected folks over the last
03:48:54 thing I did I didn't e thank
03:48:55 you, kim sheriff's office.
03:48:56 >> nice to see you.
03:49:00 Thank you.
03:49:03 >> welcome to our next speaker
03:49:04 .
03:49:07 Hi, isha humphrey.
03:49:08 I wasn't planning to speak
03:49:08 today but I felt compelled to
03:49:11 express my gratitude to
03:49:12 commissioner carter ober stone
03:49:15 for being a leader with such
03:49:16 principle and integrity.
03:49:19 I think that we have been lucky
03:49:20 to have someone with his
03:49:23 expertise who has been willing
03:49:24 to lend that to us to serve
03:49:24 this city.
03:49:27 He's been a pillar for civil
03:49:28 rights and the community and I
03:49:30 think it's very telling how
03:49:31 many people have come out today
03:49:32 to speak on behalf of the
03:49:32 commissioner.
03:49:34 I think that he's been an
03:49:35 excellent advocate for the
03:49:38 community and I'm grateful for
03:49:39 the opportunity to stand with
03:49:39 him.
03:49:41 I sincerely hope that this
03:49:42 board stands with him as well
03:49:45 and I urge you to vote no on
03:49:45 this motion.
03:49:46 >> thank you.
03:49:48 Thank you for your comments.
03:49:53 Welcome.
03:49:54 >> hello I'm from quadruple a
03:49:57 another of ac's army of
03:49:59 associates always hyphenated
03:50:03 american.
03:50:04 Has there been some
03:50:08 overstatements here?
03:50:08 Yes I.
03:50:11 I can't see how this voting to
03:50:15 sustain this would not be a
03:50:15 step towards losing chief scott
03:50:18 you've got to figure he's on a
03:50:22 pretty thin rope as it is and
03:50:23 you know I actually think maybe
03:50:24 you know I've been watching the
03:50:27 news a little bit and I
03:50:28 actually think this kind of
03:50:28 dynamic between public and bill
03:50:32 scott, you know, it could be a
03:50:34 good thing you got one of
03:50:34 them's a local guy and other
03:50:38 one was hired nationally you
03:50:41 know different races I think it
03:50:42 could be very dynamic and
03:50:42 depending on how long bill
03:50:45 scott's willing to put up with
03:50:46 it, you know, heck, you know, I
03:50:48 don't see bill scott as not
03:50:49 being a person willing to you
03:50:52 know, go with anything that's
03:50:53 rational and reasonable.
03:50:55 I just don't see it.
03:50:56 I think that a vote to sustain
03:51:00 this I can't see how it's not a
03:51:01 vote to get rid of bill scott
03:51:03 and I that's all about I want
03:51:07 to stay about overstatements
03:51:08 about the attempt to remove the
03:51:12 overturn the removal of
03:51:14 overtone thank you otto duffy
03:51:15 for your comments.
03:51:19 Welcome to the next speaker I,
03:51:19 I just wanted to just introduce
03:51:20 myself.
03:51:22 >> my name's obama.
03:51:23 I was born and raised here
03:51:24 in the city.
03:51:26 I'm also on the sheriff's
03:51:27 oversight board.
03:51:27 I by no means am speaking on
03:51:30 behalf of that board.
03:51:31 Speaking specifically as a
03:51:34 citizen myself I think carolyn
03:51:37 gossip from the public
03:51:38 defender's office mentioned
03:51:38 this earlier about how
03:51:42 collaborative max overseeing
03:51:45 was and I just wanted to add to
03:51:46 that in support of him he came
03:51:49 along with the human rights
03:51:50 commission and the somewhat
03:51:53 community development center to
03:51:54 speak on behalf of to speak to
03:51:57 the pacific islander community
03:51:58 which is where I'm from and I
03:52:01 thought it was very helpful to
03:52:01 to kind of share out the
03:52:05 pretextual policy and I just
03:52:08 wanted to add my support on
03:52:11 behalf of keeping max on the
03:52:12 board to the commission.
03:52:12 >> thank you.
03:52:16 Thank you for your comments
03:52:16 before the next speaker you're
03:52:19 welcome to come up sir.
03:52:20 >> before you begin though,
03:52:21 just want to invite any other
03:52:23 members of the public who are
03:52:23 here to address this item the
03:52:27 consideration of the removal of
03:52:28 commissioner obra stone please
03:52:28 come on up if you're ready to
03:52:31 speak otherwise this MAY be our
03:52:35 last speaker welcome sir.
03:52:35 I am lord justice and I want to
03:52:39 give all praise and glory to my
03:52:42 creator oh I to like a few of
03:52:43 the last speakers were
03:52:46 compelled to speak.
03:52:46 It's evident that there are no
03:52:49 criminal charges.
03:52:50 There's no question of ethics
03:52:53 or professionalism or else will
03:52:53 be in a different venue so
03:52:57 people such as myself will dig
03:52:58 deeper and investigate to see
03:53:01 what is the root of this
03:53:02 problem and it also enables us
03:53:05 to see who's on law is payroll.
03:53:09 So with that being said, it's
03:53:09 been evident that you hold a
03:53:12 seat, you hold a position to
03:53:16 listen to the people we have
03:53:17 opened up and we have held a
03:53:17 long dialog.
03:53:20 We have said what we want, what
03:53:23 we desire and with evidence so
03:53:24 it is now up to you as our own
03:53:27 you to do what you ought to do.
03:53:28 You hold no alliance to no one
03:53:31 but the truth so let it be
03:53:31 done.
03:53:32 >> thank you sir, for your
03:53:34 comments.
03:53:39 MR. PRESIDENT and with with
03:53:42 that public comment is closed
03:53:49 and I will declare item 21 to
03:53:52 have been heard and filed and
03:53:58 now supervisor dorsey thank
03:53:59 you, PRESIDENT Mandolin
03:54:00 colleagues, I think it's
03:54:02 important to frame
03:54:03 dispassionately and accurately
03:54:05 what is before us in this
03:54:09 hearing because charter section
03:54:10 4.19 provides that members of
03:54:13 our police commission generally
03:54:14 serve at the pleasure of their
03:54:17 appointing authority.
03:54:18 In other words, they MAY be
03:54:21 removed without cause except
03:54:22 that mayoral appointments and
03:54:22 removals are also subject to
03:54:25 board approval.
03:54:26 Now this is very different from
03:54:28 the approximately two dozen for
03:54:29 cause commissions whose
03:54:32 appointees are genuinely
03:54:32 independent and by design
03:54:33 beyond the reach of their
03:54:36 appointing authorities once
03:54:37 they're appointed these for
03:54:37 cause appointees MAY only be
03:54:40 removed for official misconduct
03:54:41 and examples of those
03:54:44 commissions include the airport
03:54:45 commission, the board of
03:54:46 appeals, elections commission,
03:54:48 ethics commission, health
03:54:48 commission, mta board among
03:54:49 many others.
03:54:52 By my count there is about 23
03:54:53 for cause commissions.
03:54:56 The police commission is not
03:54:56 one of them.
03:54:59 >> the reason that distinction
03:55:00 is important is that it shows
03:55:01 that our city charter
03:55:04 thoughtfully contemplate dates
03:55:05 that some commissions are
03:55:08 intended to have independently
03:55:08 empowered appointees and some
03:55:09 other commissions including the
03:55:12 police commission are not
03:55:12 designed that way.
03:55:13 Police commissioners are
03:55:16 generally accountable to their
03:55:16 appointing authority and that
03:55:19 is by design.
03:55:20 The narrow role we play here
03:55:23 in this hearing is akin to an
03:55:24 advice and consent role.
03:55:27 It isn't necessary for us to
03:55:28 reach any factual conclusion or
03:55:32 to make any finding to consent
03:55:32 to the mayor's removal of his
03:55:35 own appointee or his
03:55:36 appointment for that matter.
03:55:39 And so for me it's a very
03:55:40 simple analysis that comes down
03:55:41 to whether we should honor the
03:55:43 committee necessary for the two
03:55:44 co-equal branches of our local
03:55:47 the legislative and the
03:55:47 executive to govern effectively
03:55:50 and well and that's especially
03:55:51 important at a time when we
03:55:52 frankly have more urgent
03:55:54 priority is facing our city
03:55:54 than this one.
03:55:55 We have a newly elected
03:55:59 executive and mayor lurie who
03:56:00 has earned the right to seek
03:56:02 his own appointment where their
03:56:03 authorized as they are here
03:56:04 absent some extraordinary
03:56:07 circumstance, some grievous
03:56:08 error that we are losing a once
03:56:11 in a generation talent the lone
03:56:11 bulwark against fascism itself
03:56:14 which I haven't seen there is
03:56:15 no legitimate basis I have seen
03:56:17 to dissent from the mayor's
03:56:18 removal here now I have worked
03:56:22 for various offices in city
03:56:24 hall for nearly 20 years and it
03:56:25 has been my observation that
03:56:28 most conscientious public
03:56:28 servants who are at will
03:56:31 employee appointees usually
03:56:32 offer to step aside voluntarily
03:56:35 when there's a new mayor and
03:56:36 yes to do the classy thing so
03:56:39 that other worthy san
03:56:39 franciscans MAY have their own
03:56:42 opportunity to serve our city.
03:56:43 So to the extent there's
03:56:43 anything unusual here, it's
03:56:47 that this appointee doesn't
03:56:47 want to step aside and that's
03:56:48 fine.
03:56:50 That's his right.
03:56:51 But neither does it cause me to
03:56:53 look favorably on his retention
03:56:53 .
03:56:54 >> now I assume I reflect the
03:56:55 perspective of all my
03:56:58 colleagues here when I express
03:57:01 my appreciation to MR. Carter
03:57:02 oberstar and for his service to
03:57:02 our city.
03:57:06 I thank him for his work on a
03:57:07 commission that is known for a
03:57:09 lot of hard work often
03:57:10 thankless and in fact I'm
03:57:11 writing legislation to expand
03:57:14 opportunities for rewards
03:57:14 in homicide cases based on the
03:57:15 resolution.
03:57:17 MR. Carter oberstar authored
03:57:18 and I applaud his good work.
03:57:21 >> there's certainly no hard
03:57:22 feelings intended for me but at
03:57:26 the end of the day I don't
03:57:26 believe this is about MR.
03:57:27 Carter over stone.
03:57:29 >> I believe it is about what
03:57:30 the city charter says about
03:57:30 mayoral authority over mayoral
03:57:33 appointments.
03:57:34 In my view mayor lurie has
03:57:34 earned by virtue of his
03:57:37 election the right to make an
03:57:38 appointment of his choosing
03:57:40 exactly as the city charter
03:57:41 intends for mayoral appointees
03:57:44 to this commission and I've
03:57:45 seen no rationale in this
03:57:45 hearing to dissent on that
03:57:48 removal.
03:57:49 neither do I think it's a bid
03:57:51 to remove chief bill scott who
03:57:52 I will say I do consider a once
03:57:53 in a generation talent and an
03:57:56 extraordinary leader who has
03:57:56 led our police department
03:57:57 through 21st century police
03:58:00 reforms that led the nation.
03:58:02 However, on item two I would
03:58:03 move that this board consent to
03:58:06 the mayor's removal of max
03:58:07 carter ober stone from the san
03:58:10 francisco police commission.
03:58:10 >> thank you supervisor dorsey
03:58:14 there is a motion to change the
03:58:18 motion to say confirm is there
03:58:25 a second seconded by sherril
03:58:29 supervisor fielder thank you,
03:58:29 PRESIDENT.
03:58:30 >> thank you commissioner

03:59:07 dozens of other committee
03:59:10 organization ones that come
03:59:11 from all corners of san
03:59:14 francisco and for riding us
03:59:14 in these past couple of weeks
03:59:19 it is absolute the right of the
03:59:22 mayor to put forward this
03:59:23 motion and it is also our right
03:59:26 to reject that.
03:59:27 >> public safety is among my
03:59:30 top priorities as district nine
03:59:31 supervisor representing mission
03:59:34 berlin portola because during
03:59:35 my two year campaign I talked
03:59:37 to thousands of constituents at
03:59:38 their doors a significant
03:59:39 proportion of whom talked about
03:59:42 wanting to feel safe walking to
03:59:44 school to work and just living
03:59:48 their daily lives that safety
03:59:52 was put at risk for a police
03:59:56 practice that commissioner
03:59:57 carter aubuchon had exactly
04:00:00 warned about and I was I'm
04:00:01 talking about the crash
04:00:04 involving a as a vehicle on
04:00:07 super bowl sunday.
04:00:08 I've said before in this
04:00:09 chamber that when I got the
04:00:12 call that six people were sent
04:00:15 to the hospital including a mom
04:00:18 and child, I didn't know what
04:00:19 scene I was going to arrive at
04:00:23 and I want to address the
04:00:24 misconception that pretext
04:00:26 stops prevent officers from
04:00:30 pursuing want to vehicles
04:00:33 pretext stops did not stop as
04:00:34 if pd from pursuing a wanted
04:00:38 vehicle for miles from stone's
04:00:41 town all the way to the mission
04:00:42 crashing specifically this
04:00:46 wanted car crashing into a
04:00:47 light pole at 20 for the
04:00:49 mission another car that was
04:00:50 parked and then eventually the
04:00:53 parklet I saw the video for
04:00:56 myself and I've said before it
04:00:59 is a miracle no one died
04:01:03 in this crash.
04:01:03 >> these people are my
04:01:04 constituents that were sent to
04:01:06 the hospital.
04:01:07 I've spoken with a couple of
04:01:10 them who want accountability
04:01:11 from us a pd as much as
04:01:17 accountable for the suspects.
04:01:18 San franciscans have been told
04:01:21 that if we abandon reform, if
04:01:22 we abandon independent
04:01:26 oversight and if we give law
04:01:26 enforcement complete control
04:01:30 over budgets, over how they use
04:01:33 force, how they profile
04:01:33 suspects, how they chase
04:01:37 vehicles, how they spend their
04:01:38 own time that everything
04:01:41 regarding public safety will be
04:01:42 solved and san franciscans have
04:01:45 essentially been sold the story
04:01:45 that an accountable police
04:01:49 force is an ineffective police
04:01:53 force and voters through their
04:01:53 rejection of prop f in NOVEMBER
04:01:56 and also prop d around
04:01:57 commissions resoundingly sent
04:02:01 the message that they want
04:02:01 accountability as much as they
04:02:04 want public safety.
04:02:07 >> an accountable police force
04:02:08 is one that is held to the
04:02:08 highest standards of
04:02:11 responsibility.
04:02:12 >> an accountable police force
04:02:14 is one that is responsible for
04:02:15 every dollar just as every
04:02:16 other department is made to
04:02:19 justify their expenses just as
04:02:20 every nonprofit is made to
04:02:23 justify their expenses, an
04:02:26 accountable police force is one
04:02:30 that uses resources wisely that
04:02:30 ensures officers are not
04:02:33 putting the public at do risk
04:02:37 due to their own burnout.
04:02:38 >> an accountable police force
04:02:40 is one that knows its community
04:02:41 members and makes meaningful
04:02:46 progress on doj reforms.
04:02:46 People coming up for public
04:02:49 comment have talked about the
04:02:50 various people that have died
04:02:53 at the hands of the pd alex
04:02:53 nieto.
04:02:54 >> luis can go to pat mario
04:02:57 woods so many more and we have
04:03:01 made tremendous progress in the
04:03:05 past handful of years on the
04:03:08 doj reforms under an
04:03:11 independent police commission,
04:03:12 an accountable police force.
04:03:16 >> I believe is possible and I
04:03:20 see glimmers of hope in a true
04:03:22 community oriented police force
04:03:27 every day in district nine.
04:03:27 >> I mention all this because
04:03:28 commissioner max carter
04:03:30 robertson and I both know that
04:03:33 his removal is bigger than him
04:03:34 and that his removal is going
04:03:37 to lend towards not just
04:03:37 in unaccountable and less
04:03:41 effective police force but also
04:03:42 a chilling effect on any
04:03:45 oversight whatsoever that will
04:03:45 ultimately put members of the
04:03:48 members of the public in danger
04:03:49 .
04:03:49 >> commissioner carter
04:03:52 robertson has been a steadfast
04:03:53 advocate for reforms and
04:03:53 oversight.
04:03:57 His leadership has been smart,
04:04:00 principled and moral.
04:04:01 >> his work revealing the
04:04:03 corrupt practices of the last
04:04:04 administration earned him a
04:04:14 national award.
04:04:15 >> it is not anti-police to
04:04:18 want oversight just as us
04:04:22 politicians have to report on
04:04:25 conflicts of interest just as
04:04:26 we have to report to the ethics
04:04:29 commission very regularly, it
04:04:30 is on a principle that trust is
04:04:32 earned and he represents the
04:04:36 kind of principled, uncorrupt
04:04:37 independent governance san
04:04:40 franciscans want and he should
04:04:44 be rewarded for his service not
04:04:44 punished.
04:04:48 >> and so I urge my colleagues
04:04:48 to vote against the removal of
04:04:52 commissioner carter over stone
04:04:52 and allow him to continue his
04:04:55 critical work to hold as a
04:04:56 party to the highest standards
04:04:56 of responsible and
04:04:59 accountability and serve the
04:05:00 public with the highest
04:05:01 standards of trust.
04:05:06 >> thank you.
04:05:06 Thank you supervisor I was
04:05:09 pleased fielder supervisor chan
04:05:10 thank you.
04:05:13 >> I first want to express my
04:05:14 gratitude to commissioner
04:05:17 mascara over stone for all your
04:05:20 work that you have done your
04:05:21 advocacy for police
04:05:24 accountability and advancing
04:05:25 racial equity has allowed us to
04:05:29 meet significant milestones on
04:05:30 critical reforms to our
04:05:33 policies on pretext stops,
04:05:33 excessive force and more.
04:05:36 And those are the policy that I
04:05:39 am in agreement with strongly.
04:05:43 So thank you, commissioner.
04:05:44 >> this is why it does pains me
04:05:47 greatly that we're here today.
04:05:50 San francisco is facing
04:05:51 unprecedented threats on many
04:05:54 front more than ever it means
04:05:55 that we have to work
04:05:58 strategically put aside our own
04:06:03 egos to ensure that we not only
04:06:04 protect the progress we have
04:06:07 made but contain the incredibly
04:06:10 important work to protect our
04:06:11 vulnerable and marginalized
04:06:11 communities.
04:06:14 >> I really do believe that
04:06:15 many of us especially right now
04:06:18 in this city hall are committed
04:06:19 to ensure that our police
04:06:22 department is held accountable
04:06:26 to the community and continue
04:06:27 to advance criminal justice but
04:06:31 to sustain like this meaningful
04:06:35 accountability in police
04:06:36 reform, I think we must
04:06:39 recognize that it does not
04:06:39 hinge on any one person but
04:06:43 collective work that all of us
04:06:44 have to do to push for
04:06:49 structural change an
04:06:50 independent one independent
04:06:53 commissioner does not equate to
04:06:54 an independent commission.
04:06:57 >> for the past few years I
04:06:58 think many of us have talked
04:07:01 about what can we do to make
04:07:02 not just our police commission
04:07:05 but really all our commission
04:07:06 to be independent and with
04:07:09 accountability and delivering
04:07:10 results for san franciscans.
04:07:14 >> we've been working on many
04:07:14 different legislations and
04:07:17 policy discussions including
04:07:18 one that I will be introducing
04:07:21 to really create a split
04:07:22 commission that allow the equal
04:07:25 appointments equal number of
04:07:26 point means from the executive
04:07:28 branch and legislative branch
04:07:29 to advance the work already
04:07:31 started by the proposition
04:07:32 eight commission reform so that
04:07:35 we can continue to build and
04:07:36 dependency to the san francisco
04:07:39 commission structure.
04:07:39 >> with that said again it's to
04:07:43 recognize that commission you
04:07:44 know we I'm just really
04:07:47 grateful for your work and for
04:07:48 the role that you have played
04:07:50 since you're a first term and
04:07:51 continuing into your second
04:07:51 term.
04:07:55 It is with great regret that we
04:07:59 are here and that it's we're
04:07:59 now questioning whether you are
04:08:02 able to finish out the
04:08:03 remaining of the one year.
04:08:06 But that does not mean the work
04:08:07 should stop I think hopefully
04:08:10 not for you and not for this
04:08:11 body and not for those that are
04:08:13 here in city hall.
04:08:14 So with that thank you so much,
04:08:17 commissioner and thank you
04:08:18 PRESIDENT Mendelsohn.
04:08:19 >> thank you supervisor chen
04:08:24 supervisor melgar, thank you to
04:08:27 all the members of the public
04:08:28 who took the time and made the
04:08:32 effort to provide public
04:08:36 comment today I do not believe
04:08:39 in removing commissioners or
04:08:40 supervisors before their term
04:08:43 is up when there has been no
04:08:44 malfeasance or illegal conduct.
04:08:47 >> I had a respectful
04:08:48 conversation with mayor lurie
04:08:50 yesterday and explained
04:08:51 in answer to his request for my
04:08:52 vote that his reasons for
04:08:55 introducing his motion this
04:08:55 motion that this georgetown
04:08:59 university and stanford law
04:09:03 school educated legal scholar
04:09:04 who clerked for two different
04:09:06 justices at the ninth circuit
04:09:07 court of appeals in at the U.S.
04:09:10 District court for the northern
04:09:11 district that mayor lurie's
04:09:14 reasons that commissioner
04:09:15 carter ober stone's manner has
04:09:15 been needlessly confrontational
04:09:18 and difficult to work with do
04:09:19 not rise to my standard for
04:09:23 removal and I will be voting
04:09:23 against it.
04:09:26 >> it is the same reason.
04:09:27 >> it is the same reason that I
04:09:31 have not supported and do not
04:09:31 currently support any recall
04:09:34 efforts without opining on the
04:09:38 assessment of commissioner
04:09:39 carter opus.
04:09:39 So it is difficult for our
04:09:40 mayor to work with.
04:09:42 I must point out that all of
04:09:45 our jobs in leadership here
04:09:46 in san francisco are in fact
04:09:50 characterized by having to deal
04:09:51 with different people that we
04:09:51 disagree with.
04:09:54 We all ran for these jobs and
04:09:57 knew that coming in the police
04:09:58 commission should be a place
04:10:02 for debate and a variety of
04:10:02 viewpoints should be allowed.
04:10:06 >> we live still thankfully
04:10:10 though at peril in a diverse
04:10:11 representative democracy in our
04:10:14 city has always prided itself
04:10:14 in doing this the best being
04:10:18 the first to move forward on
04:10:19 social justice moving through
04:10:22 our disagreements despite
04:10:22 controversy and disagreement,
04:10:23 sometimes even violent
04:10:26 disagreement.
04:10:27 >> and as a former planning
04:10:29 commissioner myself I would say
04:10:30 that you don't have to agree
04:10:30 with your colleagues all the
04:10:33 time but that doesn't mean that
04:10:34 they aren't adding something
04:10:37 valuable to the conversation
04:10:38 and that they don't represent
04:10:42 viewpoints that members of our
04:10:43 community have.
04:10:43 >> there is no question that
04:10:46 commissioner carter ober stone
04:10:47 was selected because he has the
04:10:50 background to be qualified to
04:10:50 serve.
04:10:51 In fact he is eminently
04:10:54 qualified and whether you agree
04:10:55 with his viewpoints or not he
04:10:57 has served with distinction.
04:11:01 The charter is clear the mayor
04:11:02 quote the mayor with the
04:11:03 consent of the board of
04:11:05 supervisors with the consent of
04:11:06 the board of supervisors MAY
04:11:09 remove a member.
04:11:10 The mayor has nominated the
04:11:13 board of supervisors MAY remove
04:11:14 a member of the rules that the
04:11:17 rules committee has nominated.
04:11:18 While I acknowledge that the
04:11:21 charter gives the mayor the
04:11:22 ability to do this if the
04:11:25 intention of the charter were
04:11:26 for commissioners to follow the
04:11:29 policy of the current mayor and
04:11:30 not the mayor who appointed
04:11:33 them or the appointing board
04:11:33 for that matter the terms of
04:11:36 the police commissioners would
04:11:37 be coterminous with their
04:11:39 appointing authority.
04:11:43 There are 429 days until APRIL
04:11:46 30th when commissioner roger
04:11:47 stone term expires.
04:11:50 we all as elected officials
04:11:51 have to live with restraints to
04:11:54 our power.
04:11:54 This is unprecedented and
04:11:58 unusual and I cannot put my
04:11:59 name in favor of this motion
04:12:01 and I have to say commissioner
04:12:02 carter over stone thank you
04:12:04 very much for your service to
04:12:08 our city.
04:12:08 Thank you.
04:12:12 Supervisor melgar we have an
04:12:12 amendment before us which is
04:12:15 made by supervisor dorsey and
04:12:16 seconded by supervisor sherril

04:19:48 Clerk let's go to a roll call
04:19:48 supervisor mahmood first to
04:19:51 introduce new business.
04:19:51 >> thank you.
04:19:54 Clerk thank you, PRESIDENT
04:19:55 Colleagues san francisco
04:19:56 remains in the midst of a
04:19:59 deadly fentanyl crisis with 633
04:20:02 fatal overdoses reported
04:20:05 in 2024 down from 810 in 2020
04:20:06 three but far above
04:20:09 pre-pandemic levels.
04:20:10 >> fentanyl itself accounts for
04:20:12 approximately 80% of overdose
04:20:13 deaths in the recent years with
04:20:16 even trace amounts proving
04:20:16 fatal exacerbating public
04:20:19 health and safety concerns with
04:20:20 open air drug markets in san
04:20:23 francisco contributing to the
04:20:24 growing fentanyl crisis
04:20:25 resulting in overdoses, mass
04:20:27 shootings, reduced public
04:20:28 safety and lower quality of
04:20:28 life for residents.
04:20:31 >> the impact on our
04:20:32 communities is disheartening.
04:20:33 >> that's why today I'm
04:20:35 introducing a resolution with
04:20:36 co-sponsorship from supervisor
04:20:39 matt dorsey and PRESIDENT
04:20:40 Rafael randleman for the
04:20:41 implementation of a drug market
04:20:43 intervention or dmi strategy to
04:20:44 address our city's fentanyl
04:20:47 crisis.
04:20:47 >> I believe this is necessary
04:20:48 because what we are seeing
04:20:50 in our streets is not normal.
04:20:51 >> for too long our communities
04:20:54 have been told to just accept
04:20:54 an open air drug market outside
04:20:57 their doorstep as the new
04:20:58 normal.
04:20:58 >> but it's not normal for 3000
04:21:02 500 children and their families
04:21:03 who live in our neighborhood to
04:21:04 walk past drug dealers every
04:21:04 day.
04:21:06 And it's not normal for people
04:21:07 to suffer on our streets and be
04:21:10 exploited by dealers.
04:21:11 >> but this resolution calls
04:21:13 for the implementation of a
04:21:14 three step model based on a
04:21:14 drug market intervention
04:21:17 strategy a framework of
04:21:18 incapacitation deterrence,
04:21:18 prevention of open air drug
04:21:21 markets and partnership
04:21:22 contracting.
04:21:22 A professor of criminal justice
04:21:25 david kennedy, who pioneered
04:21:26 the program and expanded its
04:21:26 use during the obama
04:21:29 administration to curb violent
04:21:29 crime and drug traffic
04:21:32 trafficking nationwide.
04:21:33 >> in fact, demise rooted
04:21:34 in proven methodologies that
04:21:37 have successfully curbed open
04:21:38 air drug markets by nearly 50%
04:21:40 in the cities that has operated
04:21:41 in and is undergoing pilots
04:21:41 in other cities today professor
04:21:45 kennedy has spent his life
04:21:46 creating new strategies to stop
04:21:48 gun violence and close open air
04:21:49 drug markets often through non
04:21:52 carceral methods.
04:21:52 By contracting with david
04:21:53 kennedy we would essentially
04:21:56 contract a specialist to assess
04:21:56 the unique aspects of open air
04:21:59 drug markets in san francisco
04:22:00 to diagnose the problem and not
04:22:03 only prescribe a solution but
04:22:04 work with our city departments
04:22:05 on a path towards
04:22:07 implementation through the drug
04:22:08 market agency coordination
04:22:08 center.
04:22:09 >> we already have an
04:22:11 interagency task force which
04:22:14 brings S.F. Pd and dpw together
04:22:15 in a concerted effort to
04:22:16 address this ecosystem that
04:22:19 contributes to the markets and
04:22:20 in implementing dmi this
04:22:22 resolution would expand on
04:22:23 demak operations allowing for
04:22:24 us live pd to hold drug dealers
04:22:27 accountable while increasing
04:22:27 support for workforce and youth
04:22:28 development and strengthening
04:22:31 community based drug market
04:22:32 disruption initiatives.
04:22:33 And all of this gets back to
04:22:35 good governance because
04:22:35 residents often will say why
04:22:36 haven't we made progress on
04:22:36 this issue?
04:22:39 Why is it getting worse?
04:22:40 >> and it's not for lack of
04:22:42 effort because we have not been
04:22:43 we've tried.
04:22:44 We need to be working more
04:22:46 methodically and tailoring this
04:22:47 approach specifically to our
04:22:48 city and that's why this
04:22:51 approach we are pushing forward
04:22:51 it has unanimous support from
04:22:54 the department some chicago
04:22:54 democratic county central
04:22:55 committee including the speaker
04:22:58 emerita nancy pelosi who
04:22:59 endorsed this framework last
04:22:59 year.
04:23:02 And we're tackling an evolving
04:23:03 crisis that has gone on for too
04:23:03 long.
04:23:06 As a board we voted in favor of
04:23:07 the mayor's fentanyl emergency
04:23:07 ordinance and using the
04:23:10 fundraising abilities of his
04:23:10 office.
04:23:11 >> I believe this can be funded
04:23:13 without using our budgets.
04:23:14 >> so let me be clear this is a
04:23:15 national strategy to begin to
04:23:18 make progress on this crisis.
04:23:18 Dema has saved countless lives
04:23:21 across the city.
04:23:22 It's past time to bring it to
04:23:22 san francisco as well and I
04:23:23 wanted to acknowledge against
04:23:25 supervisor dorsey who has been
04:23:28 advocating for this
04:23:28 infrastructure and this
04:23:29 initiative for years and
04:23:32 excited to co-sponsor this with
04:23:33 him as well.
04:23:33 >> I'd also like to introduce
04:23:40 and in memoriam in memoriam an
04:23:41 adjournment for a betty MAY
04:23:42 cooke's colleagues asked that
04:23:44 we adjourn her memory who
04:23:45 passed away after nearly five
04:23:48 decades of shaping and serving
04:23:48 the fillmore and western
04:23:49 edition communities.
04:23:51 >> there was a beautiful
04:23:52 service held in community for
04:23:53 her this past weekend full of
04:23:56 love and appreciation from
04:23:56 those whose lives she touched
04:23:57 in speaking with her daughter
04:24:00 tanisha, it's evident that
04:24:00 betty lived fully in that her
04:24:01 spirit lives and through her
04:24:03 impact.
04:24:04 >> betty was born in 1940 three
04:24:07 in prichard, alabama and moved
04:24:07 to san francisco in 1951.
04:24:11 >> she's graduated mission high
04:24:11 school.
04:24:12 She met and married the love of
04:24:12 her life.
04:24:14 James cooks in 1964 and
04:24:14 together they raised four
04:24:17 children faith patrick, tanisha
04:24:21 and antonio building a family
04:24:22 grounded in love and resilience
04:24:25 in 19 76 betty opened jp beauty
04:24:29 boutique, a business that
04:24:29 became a cornerstone of the
04:24:32 fillmore for 48 years she kept
04:24:33 her doors open through economic
04:24:35 shifts and neighborhood
04:24:36 changes, remaining a steadfast
04:24:39 presence just last year her
04:24:39 contributions were officially
04:24:43 recognized when jp beauty
04:24:43 boutique was added to the san
04:24:44 francisco legacy business
04:24:47 registry ensuring her name and
04:24:48 impact would be enshrined
04:24:48 in our city's history.
04:24:51 Betty's influence extended far
04:24:51 beyond her business.
04:24:54 She was a mentor, a trailblazer
04:24:55 for black entrepreneurs and a
04:24:55 symbol of perseverance.
04:24:58 She touched countless lives
04:24:59 customers, employees and
04:25:02 community members alike thanks
04:25:03 to the efforts of brothers for
04:25:03 change and the broader
04:25:06 community, betty was able to
04:25:07 receive her flowers while she
04:25:09 was still with us.
04:25:10 >> she is survived by her
04:25:13 husband of 60 years james her
04:25:14 sister barbara, her children,
04:25:14 her grandchildren and an
04:25:16 extended family that goes
04:25:17 beyond blood ties.
04:25:18 her presence will be felt
04:25:21 in every stylist she inspired,
04:25:21 every customer she welcomed and
04:25:22 in the fillmore community she
04:25:25 helped preserve.
04:25:25 >> we extend our deepest
04:25:26 condolences to her family,
04:25:28 friends and all who were
04:25:29 touched by her kindness and
04:25:29 unwavering dedication.
04:25:33 San francisco has lost a giant
04:25:33 but her spirit remains woven
04:25:36 into the city's fabric.
04:25:36 >> rest in peace, betty cooks.
04:25:39 MAY your memory be a blessing.
04:25:40 >> thank you.
04:25:40 Supervisor mahmood supervisor
04:25:43 mendelson.
04:25:43 Thank you, MADAM Clerk.
04:25:48 Colleagues, I have two
04:25:49 ordinances a drafting request,
04:25:52 a letter of inquiry and an
04:25:52 in memoriam.
04:25:55 >> so get out a book.
04:25:58 >> the first item is on the
04:26:02 open for business contracts
04:26:02 streamlining act of 2025 a sent
04:26:06 a set of sensible contract
04:26:07 reforms to simplify the city's
04:26:07 procurement processes reduce
04:26:10 the burden of contracting
04:26:11 regulations on small
04:26:11 businesses, nonprofits and the
04:26:14 city and encourage more
04:26:15 competition for city contracts.
04:26:18 The city and county of san
04:26:19 francisco contracts for many
04:26:20 necessary goods programs and
04:26:22 services from office supplies
04:26:23 to the installation of a new
04:26:23 subway line.
04:26:26 Contracts ranged from a few
04:26:27 thousand dollars to hundreds of
04:26:29 millions of dollars every
04:26:30 single city department engages
04:26:31 in contracting.
04:26:31 But the way we currently do
04:26:34 things is cumbersome, complex
04:26:37 and costly over time and for
04:26:38 good reasons.
04:26:38 san francisco has added
04:26:41 numerous contract related
04:26:42 ordinances that seek to use the
04:26:43 city's market participant
04:26:46 powers to advance various
04:26:46 social policy priorities.
04:26:50 Often these have come without
04:26:51 much or any consideration of
04:26:51 how the new requirements
04:26:54 interact with existing laws or
04:26:54 impact the efficiency of the
04:26:57 city's procurement process and
04:26:58 such such ordinances are rarely
04:26:58 if ever repealed or even
04:27:02 reviewed for effectiveness or
04:27:02 cost.
04:27:05 >> admit administrative code 12
04:27:05 x was an example and in some
04:27:09 ways a counterexample.
04:27:09 In 2016, in response to the
04:27:10 proliferation of laws in states
04:27:13 across the country that
04:27:13 discriminated against the lgbtq
04:27:17 community, the city enacted 12
04:27:17 acts which prohibited the city
04:27:18 from contracting with
04:27:21 businesses based in states with
04:27:21 such laws.
04:27:24 Between 2016 and 2023 the board
04:27:24 of supervisors and mayor
04:27:27 expanded the reach of 12 acts
04:27:28 to include businesses in states
04:27:31 with restrictive reproductive
04:27:32 rights and voting rights laws,
04:27:34 bringing the total number of
04:27:34 banned states to 30.
04:27:35 >> reports by the budget and
04:27:38 legislative analyst found that
04:27:39 the 12 x was creating
04:27:42 significant administrative
04:27:42 burdens for city departments
04:27:43 and reducing competition and
04:27:46 driving up costs for city
04:27:47 contracts without any
04:27:47 discernable impact on the
04:27:50 behavior of state legislatures
04:27:51 and bound states.
04:27:53 In 2023 we repealed 12 acts but
04:27:57 in the process it had become
04:27:57 clear to me that 12 x was just
04:27:58 the tip of the iceberg and that
04:28:00 our procurement processes could
04:28:04 benefit from additional pruning
04:28:05 .
04:28:06 In 2022 I submitted a letter of
04:28:08 inquiry to the city
04:28:09 administrator asking her office
04:28:09 to provide recommendations for
04:28:12 a more transparent, streamlined
04:28:13 and less costly procurement
04:28:16 process for low dollar
04:28:16 contracts to encourage greater
04:28:20 competition and support the
04:28:20 city's small businesses.
04:28:21 In MAY of 2024, city
04:28:24 administrator carmen chiu
04:28:24 released her report which found
04:28:27 the following one low dollar
04:28:27 contracts are subject to the
04:28:30 same contracting requirements
04:28:31 generally as higher value
04:28:34 contracts making executing a
04:28:35 $10,000 contract just as
04:28:38 difficult as executing a $10
04:28:41 million contract in the prior
04:28:42 five years the city had awarded
04:28:44 thousands of contracts for
04:28:46 $200,000 or less accounting for
04:28:47 59% of the city's contract
04:28:50 volume but only 1.8% of the
04:28:51 city's total contract spending
04:28:53 meant that city staff and
04:28:54 suppliers were spending
04:28:56 disproportionate time energy
04:28:57 and effort on a relatively
04:28:58 small share of the city's
04:29:00 spending.
04:29:01 >> third, the city's current
04:29:05 contracting processes and
04:29:05 requirements create a high
04:29:06 level of administrative burden
04:29:09 for both city staff and
04:29:09 suppliers, making it more
04:29:10 difficult for the city to serve
04:29:12 the public.
04:29:13 Fourth, the city's contract
04:29:13 requirements make doing
04:29:16 business with the city
04:29:17 confusing and cost prohibitive
04:29:20 for some suppliers and small
04:29:20 and local businesses and
04:29:21 nonprofits are especially
04:29:22 impacted by high barriers to
04:29:24 entry which can run counter to
04:29:25 the city's goals of local
04:29:27 investment and equitable
04:29:28 contracting.
04:29:29 And fifth, the complexity of
04:29:32 the city's contracting
04:29:32 processes MAY also be limiting
04:29:36 competition to provide the city
04:29:37 goods and services.
04:29:38 For example, in fiscal year
04:29:39 2023 nearly half the
04:29:40 solicitations that the office
04:29:43 of contract administration
04:29:43 issued received just a single
04:29:47 response or no response at all.
04:29:47 That's not a competitive
04:29:48 process designed to get us the
04:29:51 best product at the best price.
04:29:52 So the city administrator's
04:29:55 report made five recommendation
04:29:55 to help address these problems.
04:29:58 One of these challenges one
04:29:58 improve the informal
04:30:01 procurement process which
04:30:02 refers to procurements under
04:30:02 the city's minimum competitive
04:30:05 amount currently $230,000 but
04:30:07 reset every five years to
04:30:08 simplify the city's contract.
04:30:11 Standard contract terms and
04:30:12 conditions which are
04:30:13 significantly longer than those
04:30:15 in other city cities and
04:30:15 municipalities.
04:30:15 Three.
04:30:18 Amend the city's procurement
04:30:19 requirements, update and
04:30:20 reconcile inconsistencies
04:30:23 in processes thresholds and
04:30:24 triggers for standardized
04:30:27 future procurement legislation
04:30:27 .
04:30:27 And five increase
04:30:28 inter-departmental coordination
04:30:32 in contracting and align policy
04:30:33 and administrative processes
04:30:36 across departments so the open
04:30:36 for business contract
04:30:40 streamlining act of 2025 builds
04:30:40 on the recommendations of the
04:30:43 city administrators report to
04:30:44 begin lessening the burden of
04:30:47 contracting regulations on
04:30:47 small businesses.
04:30:48 Nonprofits and the city
04:30:50 encourage more equity and
04:30:51 competition for city contracts
04:30:54 and ensure improved service
04:30:55 delivery for san franciscans.
04:30:57 And when I say begin lessening
04:30:58 I mean that I hope and trust
04:30:59 that over the next several
04:31:02 years we will together find
04:31:03 many more opportunities to go
04:31:05 further than this legislation
04:31:07 to move our out of its own way
04:31:09 and to create more
04:31:10 opportunities for more
04:31:11 businesses and especially local
04:31:13 small businesses to compete for
04:31:13 our work.
04:31:17 This legislation would create a
04:31:18 model template to standardize
04:31:19 future contracting ordinances
04:31:21 require the city administrator
04:31:22 to review any new potential
04:31:25 ordinances that significantly
04:31:26 affect procurement processes.
04:31:26 Update out of section
04:31:29 out-of-date sections of the
04:31:30 municipal code repeal sections
04:31:33 of the municipal code that are
04:31:34 no longer in use or are
04:31:35 duplicative of state law and
04:31:37 standardize thresholds across a
04:31:38 number of sections of the code.
04:31:40 There's certainly more much
04:31:41 more to be done and I look
04:31:42 forward to working with you
04:31:43 colleagues to do it.
04:31:45 I want to thank the many people
04:31:45 that have worked hard on this
04:31:48 legislation and reform effort
04:31:49 over a couple of years.
04:31:53 That is first our city
04:31:53 administrator carmen chu and
04:31:56 her exceptional staff
04:31:56 especially sophie hayward.
04:31:59 Rachel zukerman say a corella
04:32:00 and angela yip as well as molly
04:32:03 peterson and on torn on the gov
04:32:04 ops team.
04:32:05 I want to thank our drafting
04:32:07 attorney gus schreiber and
04:32:08 thank the many departments and
04:32:10 stakeholders with whom we've
04:32:11 conferred along the way and
04:32:12 who've been generous in sharing
04:32:12 their time.
04:32:15 Finally I want to thank henry
04:32:15 de ruff and melanie matheson
04:32:19 in my office as well as our
04:32:19 choral fellow mave skelly for
04:32:20 all of their work.
04:32:22 And I want to thank my early
04:32:23 co-sponsors matt dorsey and
04:32:26 bilal mahmood.
04:32:26 >> all right.
04:32:30 The drafting request that I am
04:32:31 submitting to the city attorney
04:32:33 to raise the threshold for
04:32:34 board approval of acceptance
04:32:37 and expenditure of grants from
04:32:41 $100,000 to $1 million and and
04:32:42 the letter of inquiry I am
04:32:43 sending is to the comptroller
04:32:45 to request that he prepare and
04:32:46 provide within 90 days
04:32:49 suggested accounting protocols
04:32:49 and procedures to make this
04:32:52 change without compromising
04:32:53 necessary financial controls by
04:32:54 the comptroller's office.
04:32:56 Securing board approval of
04:32:57 grant accepted expense is time
04:33:00 consuming although at almost
04:33:01 invariably results in the
04:33:01 board's approval of the grant.
04:33:04 And while board oversight is
04:33:04 important for many functions of
04:33:05 city I do not believe our pre
04:33:08 review and approval of grants
04:33:11 less than $1 million is
04:33:12 necessary or desirable in most
04:33:15 cases there are excess grants
04:33:15 with local matching
04:33:16 requirements and grants
04:33:18 requiring new hires have
04:33:19 implications for our general
04:33:21 fund but for most grants under
04:33:22 $1 million the controllers
04:33:23 review should be enough.
04:33:25 I want to thank the department
04:33:26 of the environment and
04:33:27 specifically leo chief for
04:33:29 responding to what was
04:33:30 originally my request to help
04:33:31 us understand ways for the city
04:33:33 to more effectively and quickly
04:33:33 pull down federal environmental
04:33:37 grants.
04:33:37 Those were the days.
04:33:38 Thanks as well to sophie
04:33:40 hayward and the city
04:33:41 administrator's office
04:33:42 comptroller greg wagner and his
04:33:44 accounting team for their
04:33:45 initial feedback on this
04:33:46 proposal and henry trf and
04:33:48 melanie matheson again on my
04:33:49 team for their work on this
04:33:52 initiative.
04:33:53 >> the other ordinance I am
04:33:56 introducing today is an
04:33:56 ordinance is a law a measure,
04:34:00 an ordinance to provide relief
04:34:01 to scores of property owners
04:34:04 who were unwittingly and
04:34:04 through no fault of their own
04:34:08 swept up in the sad and sorry
04:34:08 saga of bernie curren and
04:34:11 rodrigo santos.
04:34:12 In JANUARY 2023 rodrigo santos
04:34:15 a building and construction
04:34:16 engineer who had done extensive
04:34:17 work in san francisco and
04:34:19 served on the city's building
04:34:20 inspection commission and city
04:34:23 college board of trustees was
04:34:24 found guilty of leading
04:34:27 multiple fraud schemes tax
04:34:28 evasion and providing falsified
04:34:28 documents to the federal bureau
04:34:31 of investigations.
04:34:32 Santos had defrauded his
04:34:35 clients, submitted false plans
04:34:36 to the department of building
04:34:37 inspection and worked beyond
04:34:39 the scope of his permits and
04:34:39 dozens more than that often
04:34:40 times.
04:34:43 >> he also stole money from his
04:34:43 clients by misrepresenting the
04:34:46 fees that were owed to gbi and
04:34:47 keeping the difference.
04:34:50 That same year former gbi
04:34:51 inspector bernie kern was found
04:34:54 guilty of accepting illegal
04:34:55 gratuities for personal gain
04:34:57 in connection with building
04:34:58 inspections he had performed on
04:35:01 those santos properties.
04:35:02 Santos had made payments to
04:35:04 current to approve illegal work
04:35:05 including unauthorized
04:35:06 demolitions and unpermitted
04:35:06 construction.
04:35:10 >> the convictions, however,
04:35:10 were not the end of the story
04:35:13 for the city or for the owners
04:35:14 of properties that santos and
04:35:16 curran had touched.
04:35:17 In MAY 2021, gbi had initiated
04:35:20 an internal review of
04:35:21 properties that were associated
04:35:23 with either man.
04:35:24 Gbi identified nearly 5500 such
04:35:27 properties to be audited.
04:35:28 The internal quality control
04:35:29 audit looked for evidence of
04:35:31 work done beyond the scope of a
04:35:32 permit, unpermitted work,
04:35:34 missing inspections and other
04:35:34 violations.
04:35:35 It was completed this past
04:35:38 JANUARY and the good news is
04:35:39 that no imminent life safety
04:35:39 hazards were found.
04:35:44 >> however, a roughly 2% of
04:35:44 audited profit properties were
04:35:48 found to have unauthorized work
04:35:48 that would need to be brought
04:35:51 up to current code
04:35:51 requirements.
04:35:52 Of course the vast majority of
04:35:55 these owners had purchased
04:35:55 their properties without
04:35:56 knowing that either santos or
04:35:59 kern had done and had been
04:35:59 involved in unpermitted
04:36:00 permitted work on them.
04:36:03 They had no way of knowing they
04:36:04 would be hit with notices of
04:36:06 violation requiring them to
04:36:07 undertake potentially costly
04:36:08 corrective work on the
04:36:10 properties that could require
04:36:11 payment of tens of thousands of
04:36:14 dollars in unanticipated
04:36:15 payment and architectural fees.
04:36:15 >> one owner learned that their
04:36:19 staircase was illegal and they
04:36:21 would have to and they had to
04:36:22 pay $21,000 to cover diva fees,
04:36:23 legal fees and the hiring of an
04:36:26 architect to draw up new
04:36:27 drawings and permits and secure
04:36:29 permit sets to rebuild the
04:36:30 staircase consistent with
04:36:31 current code requirements.
04:36:34 Another owner learned they had
04:36:34 to redo a driveway because it
04:36:37 was not permeable and renovate
04:36:38 their front doorway because
04:36:38 they did not have the right
04:36:41 transom.
04:36:41 A third owner learned that
04:36:42 their home had not gotten its
04:36:44 required permits and therefore
04:36:45 among other problems now
04:36:45 required a conditional use
04:36:48 permit to comply with my large
04:36:51 luxury home legislation.
04:36:52 That particular case cost this
04:36:54 poor owner more than $50,000
04:36:57 in planning permit and legal
04:36:58 fees.
04:36:59 The ordinance I'm introducing
04:37:01 will establish an amnesty
04:37:02 program that will waive local
04:37:03 planning code violations for
04:37:06 this discrete set of properties
04:37:07 that were subject to dba as
04:37:09 internal quality control audit
04:37:10 .
04:37:10 The legislation will further
04:37:11 waive fees that would otherwise
04:37:14 be required to remedy such
04:37:14 violations and will allow for
04:37:15 refunds to property owners who
04:37:18 have already paid such fees.
04:37:21 I want to thank the city staff
04:37:22 who worked with us on this
04:37:23 legislation.
04:37:25 They saw the problems in going
04:37:26 after these property owners and
04:37:29 were eager to help us find a
04:37:30 way to provide relief and
04:37:33 specifically I want to thank
04:37:34 director patrick reardon at
04:37:37 wbai as well as christine
04:37:37 gasper tate, hannah patrick
04:37:41 hannon and matthew green on
04:37:41 in his department liz waddy and
04:37:44 erin starr from planning austin
04:37:45 yang, rob coppola, kristen
04:37:46 jensen and peter million from
04:37:48 the city attorney's office and
04:37:49 calvin from my office.
04:37:52 And lastly colleagues I am
04:37:53 asking that we adjourn today's
04:37:54 memory today's meeting
04:37:56 in memory of joe chavez who
04:37:57 died on FEBRUARY 1st at the age
04:37:57 of 89.
04:38:00 Joe was born in redlands,
04:38:01 california in 1935.
04:38:03 At 18 he joined the navy after
04:38:04 tours in japan and the
04:38:06 philippines.
04:38:07 He was stationed at treasure
04:38:08 island, which is when his love
04:38:10 of san francisco began.
04:38:11 Joe later moved to san
04:38:11 francisco after leaving the
04:38:14 navy and put down roots in the
04:38:14 castro.
04:38:15 He was a founding partner of
04:38:18 castro village wine company, a
04:38:19 small boutique wine shop in the
04:38:21 in the heart of the castro
04:38:22 neighborhood.
04:38:24 Established in 1980 cv iwc
04:38:25 specialized in the sale of fine
04:38:29 californian wines.
04:38:30 Joe and his partner boyd swartz
04:38:31 envisioned the store as more
04:38:33 than just a business.
04:38:34 They wanted to create a
04:38:34 community space for and
04:38:37 lesbians in the castro.
04:38:38 Joe and boyd were part of the
04:38:38 lavender wave that swept
04:38:41 through eureka valley in the
04:38:41 1970s and 80s establishing the
04:38:44 castro as america's most
04:38:45 important neighborhood.
04:38:48 They repaired, rebuilt and
04:38:49 invested in properties and they
04:38:49 were known to be amazing
04:38:52 landlords.
04:38:53 Yes, good landlords are a thing
04:38:56 and joe and boyd were it.
04:38:57 Castro village wine company has
04:38:58 been featured in local and
04:39:00 national publications including
04:39:01 the san francisco bay times
04:39:04 wine enthusiast line S.F. Est
04:39:04 and the bay area reporter.
04:39:05 There they were known for
04:39:08 providing jobs, mentorship and
04:39:09 professional development
04:39:09 opportunities for women people
04:39:12 of color and individuals
04:39:13 interested in the wine and
04:39:13 spirits industry.
04:39:16 And in 2012 former mayor ed lee
04:39:18 declared MAY 12th castro
04:39:19 village wine company day.
04:39:22 Boyd predeceased joe 13 years
04:39:22 ago.
04:39:23 Joe was one of the very, very
04:39:26 good ones and I'm going to MISS
04:39:27 Running into him out about
04:39:27 in the neighborhood.
04:39:29 He always liked to chat about
04:39:30 political gossips and city hall
04:39:33 goings on.
04:39:34 Our deepest condolences go out
04:39:35 to joe's friends, family and
04:39:35 loved ones.
04:39:38 Rest in peace and power joe
04:39:38 chavez.
04:39:39 MAY your memory be a blessing
04:39:41 and the rest I submit.
04:39:42 >> thank you, MR. PRESIDENT.
04:39:45 Supervisor melgar submit.
04:39:45 thank you.
04:39:49 Submit supervisor sartor.
04:39:50 >> submit.
04:39:50 Thank you.
04:39:53 Supervisor sherril colleagues.
04:39:54 Last week PRESIDENT Trump is
04:39:57 issued a ridiculous executive
04:39:57 order that targeted the
04:40:00 presidio for dramatic cuts and
04:40:01 I use the word dramatic because
04:40:04 that is all this is drama
04:40:04 reality tv style drama.
04:40:08 >> so in response I'm
04:40:09 introducing a resolution that
04:40:09 firmly opposes this so-called
04:40:12 executive order calls it out as
04:40:13 the political stunt that it is
04:40:16 and reaffirms the city and
04:40:17 county of san francisco support
04:40:20 for a crown jewel.
04:40:21 >> we need to clear some things
04:40:21 up.
04:40:23 The presidio trust is fully
04:40:24 statutory so an executive order
04:40:27 targeting non statutory
04:40:28 spending is nothing but hot air
04:40:31 to the 3000 residents of the
04:40:32 presidio.
04:40:35 Do not fear to the 108 formerly
04:40:39 homeless disabled veterans
04:40:39 living in the presidio do not
04:40:42 fear.
04:40:43 To the nonprofits and
04:40:44 businesses who by the way pay
04:40:46 rent to fund the presidio do
04:40:50 not fear to the seven million
04:40:50 people.
04:40:51 That's twice as many as
04:40:53 yellowstone from across the
04:40:54 economic spectrum who visit the
04:40:57 presidio every year.
04:40:58 Do not fear this order does not
04:41:01 threaten the operating budget
04:41:02 of the presidio because it is
04:41:02 fully funded by revenues
04:41:05 generated within the presidio.
04:41:09 The presidio is a model of
04:41:10 efficiency.
04:41:10 It is a shining example of
04:41:14 public private partnership s we
04:41:14 need more treasurers more
04:41:15 models like the presidio.
04:41:18 And make no mistake it is a
04:41:19 national treasure and it is a
04:41:22 crown jewel of district two.
04:41:22 And frankly this is a direct
04:41:25 result of the stewardship and
04:41:26 care delivered by the team the
04:41:29 executive team and the board
04:41:29 members of the presidio trust
04:41:30 which brought this park to
04:41:33 self-sufficiency almost a
04:41:34 decade before it was acquired
04:41:37 by federal law.
04:41:38 If only we had more examples of
04:41:40 things that reached their goals
04:41:41 a decade before it was
04:41:44 necessary.
04:41:45 Trump cannot erase the law.
04:41:49 This executive order is again
04:41:50 nothing but hot air.
04:41:53 His bluster amounts to nothing.
04:41:54 It just creates unnecessary
04:41:57 fear for the 3000 people who
04:41:57 live in the presidio and the
04:41:58 countless others who rely on
04:42:01 the park as a cherished public
04:42:01 space.
04:42:02 I hope to have all of your
04:42:04 support in opposing this
04:42:05 political theater and sending a
04:42:08 strong message to washington
04:42:09 that we will fight to ensure
04:42:09 that the presidio that we know
04:42:11 and love is not going anywhere
04:42:12 .
04:42:12 And should this PRESIDENT Act
04:42:16 up again, we will be here
04:42:16 standing strong to defend
04:42:20 against terrible wildly
04:42:20 misguided ideas.
04:42:24 >> additionally, I want to
04:42:25 thank you supervisor mahmud for
04:42:25 introducing the resolution to
04:42:28 urge the implementation of a
04:42:28 comprehensive drug market
04:42:31 intervention strategy.
04:42:31 Dmi establishes common sense
04:42:35 collaboration prioritizes
04:42:35 direct communication and
04:42:36 ensures our resources are being
04:42:39 effectively used to end the
04:42:40 scourge of fentanyl once and
04:42:40 for all.
04:42:42 Open air drug markets create a
04:42:43 perception of instability and
04:42:46 raise fear in our city.
04:42:47 And recently in our two
04:42:47 districts we have had to
04:42:50 address the challenges at
04:42:51 jefferson square park that have
04:42:52 left nearby residents feeling
04:42:54 deeply unsafe.
04:42:54 We have to focus on
04:42:55 continuously disrupting drug
04:42:57 markets and restoring order
04:42:58 in san francisco.
04:43:01 I'm glad to be a partner on
04:43:02 this issue and a co-sponsor to
04:43:03 this resolution.
04:43:06 The rest I submit.
04:43:06 >> thank you.
04:43:07 Supervisor sheryl supervisor
04:43:09 walton thank you, MADAM Clerk.
04:43:10 Colleagues today I have a
04:43:13 resolution and two in memoriam.
04:43:17 First I'm introducing a
04:43:17 resolution to reaffirm san
04:43:20 francisco's commitment to our
04:43:21 local business enterprise
04:43:21 program.
04:43:24 We will also be hosting a rally
04:43:27 next tuesday, MARCH 4th at noon
04:43:31 with our lbi and labor
04:43:31 partners.
04:43:32 Our city's chapter 14 be local
04:43:35 business enterprise program is
04:43:36 all about keeping opportunities
04:43:39 local and making sure small
04:43:40 businesses especially those
04:43:42 owned by minorities and women
04:43:43 get a fair shot at city
04:43:43 contracts.
04:43:47 When we prioritize obies we're
04:43:48 not just supporting businesses.
04:43:50 We're creating jobs,
04:43:51 strengthening communities and
04:43:54 keeping money circulating
04:43:55 in our local economy.
04:43:58 These businesses are more
04:43:59 likely to hire san franciscans,
04:44:02 pay fair wages and contribute
04:44:05 to the city's unique character
04:44:06 by reaffirming our commitment
04:44:06 to the hlb program.
04:44:10 We're doubling down on economic
04:44:10 equity and making sure all of
04:44:13 our small businesses continue
04:44:14 to thrive and are not left
04:44:14 behind.
04:44:18 Beyond economic benefits, the
04:44:18 resolution highlights the
04:44:22 city's dedication to fair labor
04:44:22 standards and inclusive
04:44:25 partnerships.
04:44:25 We're trying to uphold the
04:44:28 principles of fair wages safe
04:44:29 working conditions and
04:44:29 workforce stability by
04:44:32 encouraging the use of project
04:44:33 labor agreements and supporting
04:44:36 union projects.
04:44:37 Additionally, we are urging
04:44:40 businesses seeking to work with
04:44:41 the city to collaborate with
04:44:44 local obies in order to foster
04:44:45 stronger partnerships that
04:44:48 contribute to sustainable and
04:44:49 community driven development.
04:44:51 This resolution reaffirms san
04:44:52 francisco's leadership
04:44:53 in championing equitable
04:44:57 opportunities and ensuring that
04:44:57 small businesses and minority
04:45:00 owned enterprises have
04:45:01 meaningful participation
04:45:02 in shaping the city's future.
04:45:05 I'd like to thank our obie
04:45:06 community and labor partners

04:45:11 this.

04:49:43 >> the rest I submit thank you.
04:49:44 >> supervisor walton.
04:49:45 Supervisor chin thank you,
04:49:48 MADAM Clerk.
04:49:48 Colleagues today I'm
04:49:49 introducing an in memoriam for
04:49:52 MR. John horton, owner of san
04:49:55 francisco toyota a longtime
04:49:56 business.
04:49:59 John was born in san rafael
04:50:02 in california on APRIL 17th,
04:50:03 1952.
04:50:03 A graduate of san rafael high
04:50:04 school.
04:50:06 John attended san francisco
04:50:07 state where he was majoring
04:50:10 in business who had hopes of
04:50:10 one day becoming a corporate
04:50:11 attorney.
04:50:14 >> however, one afternoon
04:50:17 in 1971 john saw a three by
04:50:17 five card on a bulletin board
04:50:21 that said general help needed
04:50:22 at bob reynolds toyota.
04:50:25 >> john applied and was hired
04:50:29 to sweep floors, wash vehicles
04:50:30 and organize the dealership's
04:50:33 lot.
04:50:34 And in case you don't know
04:50:34 where does lott is.
04:50:37 It's on gary in on in district
04:50:40 one and it's a big lot.
04:50:41 John worked hard and discovered
04:50:44 he had a passion for cars, the
04:50:45 business and the customers.
04:50:48 He decided to take a pause from
04:50:49 school and pursue his passion
04:50:51 for the car business.
04:50:52 After years of working
04:50:55 together, he and MR. Bob
04:50:56 reynolds develop a father and
04:50:56 son relationship.
04:50:59 MR. Reynolds gave john an
04:51:00 opportunity of a lifetime to
04:51:03 own the dealership in 1987.
04:51:07 John purchased a business from
04:51:08 MR. Reynolds and changed the
04:51:11 dealership's name from bob
04:51:12 reynolds toyota to what we know
04:51:15 today as san francisco toyota.
04:51:18 As san francisco toyota began
04:51:19 to grow both in size and
04:51:22 business, john began offering
04:51:23 small sponsorship to local
04:51:26 charities and community
04:51:27 organizations and local schools
04:51:28 and all of them and most of
04:51:30 them were actually in the
04:51:31 richmond.
04:51:34 For john and his associates,
04:51:35 donating time to support the
04:51:37 community was essential and
04:51:38 throughout the years they have
04:51:39 supported an array of
04:51:42 organizations in the richmond
04:51:42 district and across san
04:51:45 francisco without ever being
04:51:46 asked and he's going to be
04:51:49 missed greatly because it's not
04:51:53 just about him and his business
04:51:56 but really about his commitment
04:51:57 to make san francisco and our
04:52:01 community and definitely to
04:52:02 richmond a better place.
04:52:05 He will be greatly missed and
04:52:06 the rest I submit.
04:52:08 >> thank you supervisor chan
04:52:08 supervisor chin submit.
04:52:09 Thank you.
04:52:14 Supervisor dorsey thank you.
04:52:15 >> thank you, MADAM Clerk.
04:52:18 Colleagues, I have two items to
04:52:19 introduce and one in memoriam.
04:52:22 First time today introducing
04:52:22 the recovery first ordinance
04:52:25 legislation that seeks to
04:52:26 provide a clear and unifying
04:52:26 policy directive for city
04:52:29 agencies and contractors whose
04:52:30 services relate to illicit drug
04:52:33 use or to mitigating its myriad
04:52:33 and deadly harms.
04:52:37 This straightforward policy
04:52:37 directive will provide as
04:52:41 follows that the cessation of
04:52:42 illicit drug use and attainment
04:52:42 of long term recovery from
04:52:45 substance use disorders shall
04:52:46 be the primary objective of the
04:52:46 city's drug policy.
04:52:49 Now in some ways this isn't
04:52:50 different from the current
04:52:51 approach of our department of
04:52:53 public health all drug
04:52:54 treatment program offers
04:52:57 in fact aim to help people stop
04:52:58 using illicit drugs.
04:53:00 But I have increasingly been
04:53:01 made aware of instances
04:53:02 in which some public health
04:53:05 contractors seem to be rowing
04:53:05 in a different direction and I
04:53:06 think that became particularly
04:53:09 clear to me at a sponsored
04:53:10 overdose prevention summit I
04:53:13 attended last month.
04:53:14 One unfortunate consequence of
04:53:17 approaches that too often seem
04:53:17 at cross-purposes with one
04:53:18 another is that it causes more
04:53:21 and more san franciscans to
04:53:21 lose confidence in our approach
04:53:25 to a drug crisis that is
04:53:25 costing far too many lives and
04:53:28 that is taking far too great a
04:53:29 toll on our city and its
04:53:30 neighborhoods until long term
04:53:32 recovery from addiction is
04:53:33 universally embraced as our
04:53:34 shared civic goal.
04:53:36 I fear that our overdose
04:53:37 prevention plans will be little
04:53:40 more than overdose postponement
04:53:40 plans.
04:53:41 I have been open
04:53:44 in acknowledging my own journey
04:53:45 and recovery from drug
04:53:46 addiction as my primary reason
04:53:48 for seeking this job and I
04:53:49 strongly believe that in much
04:53:51 the way that transit first
04:53:51 animated our city's
04:53:52 aspirational urban urbanist
04:53:58 vision five decades ago a
04:53:59 recovery first drug policy will
04:54:00 provide san francisco with a
04:54:02 clear and unifying north star.
04:54:03 We need for the new and unique
04:54:06 challenges we face in the era
04:54:06 of synthetic drugs like
04:54:09 fentanyl and methamphetamine.
04:54:10 Given the grim reality of
04:54:13 today's street drugs which are
04:54:14 more easily trafficked, more
04:54:14 profitable, more potently
04:54:16 addictive and deadlier than
04:54:17 ever before in human history, I
04:54:18 think it is time to put
04:54:20 recovery first.
04:54:21 And I'm grateful to the early
04:54:24 to my colleagues for the early
04:54:24 co-sponsorship of board
04:54:25 PRESIDENT Mandolin supervisors
04:54:29 mahmood sherril melgar and
04:54:29 guardiola and sadr.
04:54:30 And I look forward to having
04:54:32 more conversations with
04:54:33 colleagues and community
04:54:36 members to broaden support for
04:54:36 this ordinance.
04:54:37 Second relatedly, I am also
04:54:40 announcing a legislative
04:54:41 drafting request for an
04:54:41 ordinance that would govern
04:54:44 expenditures and accounting for
04:54:45 remaining opioid litigation
04:54:47 settlement dollars for the
04:54:48 duration of that fund's
04:54:48 existence.
04:54:49 The legislation would also
04:54:52 create reporting requirements
04:54:52 to keep this board and future
04:54:55 boards apprized of annual
04:54:55 expenditures.
04:54:56 And it would hopefully find
04:54:59 agreement for an approach that
04:55:00 I believe enjoys wide support
04:55:00 on this board of supervisors
04:55:03 for a four pillars drug policy
04:55:04 model.
04:55:04 Along the lines of that
04:55:07 implemented by our sister city
04:55:08 zurich, switzerland and several
04:55:10 other european cities.
04:55:11 And for those who haven't read
04:55:12 it, I would urge everyone to
04:55:14 read the a report commissioned
04:55:15 by our former colleague dean
04:55:15 preston on zurich's
04:55:18 implementation of this
04:55:18 promising approach.
04:55:19 The legislation I'm asking for
04:55:22 would require that remaining
04:55:23 dollars from the opioid
04:55:25 litigation settlement fund and
04:55:26 I believe we anticipate a total
04:55:29 recovery of at least $350
04:55:29 million for the city and its
04:55:32 taxpayers before 2040 be
04:55:33 apportioned into four
04:55:36 categories correspond with the
04:55:40 four pillars as as follows 25%
04:55:40 for prevention to educate at
04:55:44 risk populations on the deadly
04:55:45 risks of illicit drug use and
04:55:47 also to research known address
04:55:48 histories for drug involved
04:55:51 populations 25% for treatment
04:55:51 and recovery to support
04:55:52 individuals with substance use
04:55:55 disorders to access drug
04:55:56 treatment or medically assisted
04:55:58 therapy and meet for long term
04:55:59 recovery 25% for harm reduction
04:56:02 to support people who use drugs
04:56:03 to minimize risks associated
04:56:04 with illicit drug use while
04:56:07 supporting and incentivizing
04:56:07 them to make better and more
04:56:08 healthful choices.
04:56:10 And 25% for law enforcement and
04:56:11 repression to more effectively
04:56:14 mitigate public drug use and to
04:56:14 maximize the likelihood that
04:56:18 criminal justice interventions
04:56:19 for drug related lawlessness or
04:56:21 life saving interventions.
04:56:22 I welcome the opportunity to
04:56:23 work with colleagues on this
04:56:23 approach.
04:56:25 Once I have an initial draft
04:56:26 from the city attorney's office
04:56:27 and I hope to earn my
04:56:29 colleagues support.
04:56:33 >> finally at our last board
04:56:33 meeting we had only just
04:56:36 learned of the passing of
04:56:37 ethics.
04:56:40 Crowley and I as I mentioned at
04:56:40 the time of my brief request to
04:56:43 adjourn that meeting two weeks
04:56:43 ago in his honor.
04:56:44 I wanted the opportunity to
04:56:47 collaborate with his family and
04:56:48 friends, especially in the
04:56:49 labor community on an
04:56:52 in memoriam that would be
04:56:52 worthy of the man he was and
04:56:53 the lifetime of service he
04:56:56 provided to our city and to its
04:56:56 working families.
04:56:59 It's what the heavy heart to
04:57:00 offer words of remembrance to
04:57:01 somebody I considered a friend.
04:57:03 Ethics crowley was a man whose
04:57:04 impact on this city and its
04:57:07 people is impossible to
04:57:07 measure.
04:57:08 by all accounts he was more
04:57:11 than anything a man of
04:57:11 boundless love for his family,
04:57:14 for his friends, for the labor

05:00:33 and engardio.
05:00:34 Submit.
05:00:34 Thank you.
05:00:37 And supervisor fielder.
05:00:37 >> thank you, MADAM Clerk.
05:00:38 Colleagues, as you all know, we
05:00:42 are facing a growing crisis
05:00:42 in san francisco.
05:00:43 The closure of retail
05:00:46 pharmacies across our city
05:00:46 pharmacies are not just a place
05:00:50 to pick up prescriptions.
05:00:51 They are vital health care hubs
05:00:53 that provide lifesaving
05:00:56 medications, vaccines and
05:00:57 essential health services.
05:01:00 Yet due to the relentless
05:01:01 pressures of corporate
05:01:01 consolidation declining and
05:01:05 slow reimbursement rates and
05:01:05 industry mismanagement, we have
05:01:09 seen pharmacy after pharmacy
05:01:12 shed stores leaving our most
05:01:13 vulnerable residents without
05:01:13 easy access to care.
05:01:17 >> local 50 pharmacies are
05:01:18 reported to have closed in san
05:01:21 francisco between 2015 and
05:01:25 JANUARY 2025 with 12 more
05:01:26 slated to close this month.
05:01:29 >> further deepening the
05:01:30 pharmacy access crisis.
05:01:33 Seniors low income families and
05:01:34 individuals with chronic health
05:01:37 conditions are disproportion
05:01:38 greatly impacted as
05:01:38 neighborhoods risk becoming
05:01:41 pharmacy deserts.
05:01:42 >> we cannot stand by while
05:01:45 access to essential medications
05:01:46 and services are stripped away
05:01:47 from our communities.
05:01:49 >> today I'll be requesting the
05:01:50 budget and legislative analysts
05:01:53 to complete a report of the
05:01:54 feasibility of adopting a
05:01:55 cooperative pharmacy model
05:01:58 in san francisco show
05:01:58 recommendations for local and
05:01:59 state policies that would
05:02:02 support independent and co-op
05:02:03 pharmacies and proposals for
05:02:06 the city to support existing
05:02:06 independent pharmacies.
05:02:07 >> we must explore innovative
05:02:10 solutions that prioritize
05:02:11 community health over corporate
05:02:14 profits and ensure that every
05:02:15 resident has access to the
05:02:18 medications and care they need.
05:02:19 >> as part of this initiative
05:02:20 we will also conduct a
05:02:22 comprehend sieve analysis that
05:02:26 will assess national and local
05:02:26 pharmacy closure trends
05:02:27 identifying neighborhoods most
05:02:27 affected.
05:02:30 Investigate the root causes of
05:02:31 these closures including the
05:02:34 role of pharmacy benefit
05:02:34 managers and industry
05:02:35 consolidation.
05:02:38 Examine what it would take
05:02:38 legally, operationally and
05:02:39 financially to establish
05:02:43 cooperative pharmacies in san
05:02:43 francisco.
05:02:46 >> explore successful models
05:02:47 from other cities that have
05:02:48 addressed pharmacy deserts.
05:02:51 >> consider how we can expand
05:02:51 pharmacy operations through our
05:02:52 department of public health and
05:02:55 community health clinics.
05:02:55 Recommend local and state
05:02:58 policies to support independent
05:02:59 and cooperative pharmacies.
05:03:00 >> evaluate strategies for the
05:03:03 city to negotiate lower drug
05:03:03 prices to make medications more
05:03:06 affordable.
05:03:06 Identify alternative revenue
05:03:07 streams to support pharmacy.
05:03:09 Sustainability.
05:03:10 >> highlight the critical
05:03:11 health care services that
05:03:13 pharmacies provide beyond
05:03:17 prescriptions.
05:03:18 That last point.
05:03:19 The goal of this report is to
05:03:21 develop tangible actions that
05:03:22 we can take to keep our many
05:03:25 independent pharmacies open and
05:03:25 accessible for all san
05:03:26 franciscans while also
05:03:29 proposing policy solutions that
05:03:29 could help us expand
05:03:34 independent pharmacies in the
05:03:34 future.
05:03:35 I look forward to working with
05:03:38 all of you to build a future
05:03:38 where every san franciscan no
05:03:39 matter where they live has
05:03:41 access to the health care they
05:03:42 deserve.
05:03:42 >> thank you.
05:03:43 The rest I submit.
05:03:43 Thank you.
05:03:45 Supervisor fielder.
05:03:46 MR. PRESIDENT, seeing no names
05:03:47 on the roster that concludes
05:03:49 the introduction of new
05:03:50 business.
05:03:50 >> all right, let's go to
05:03:51 public comment.
05:03:53 All right.
05:03:54 Those of you who are here
05:03:54 in the chamber for general
05:03:57 public comment line up by the
05:03:57 windows on your right hand side
05:03:58 of the chamber.
05:04:01 >> you MAY speak to the minutes
05:04:01 as presented general matters
05:04:05 not on today's agenda but must
05:04:06 be within the board subject
05:04:06 matter jurisdiction.
05:04:09 >> all other agenda content
05:04:10 will have been reported out to
05:04:12 the board by an appropriate
05:04:13 committee where public comment
05:04:16 has already occurred.
05:04:17 And for those of you who are
05:04:18 in line I just want to make a
05:04:24 quick comment that the
05:04:24 committee of the whole the
05:04:25 removal of max carter over
05:04:28 stone from the police
05:04:29 commission has already had its
05:04:29 public comment.
05:04:32 So you MAY not speak to that
05:04:33 item during general public
05:04:36 comment for speaker yes, not
05:04:39 too early on.
05:04:40 >> no matter how hard you try
05:04:44 you can sidetrack me you
05:04:47 because you no matter how hard
05:04:48 you try you can't either.
05:04:51 >> you know the distribution of
05:04:52 the roads is okay.
05:04:53 >> you're going to do this.
05:04:55 You're going to use vaccines to
05:04:56 kill people and that's it.
05:04:59 So that's why I said injections
05:05:00 are not allowed by this case as
05:05:04 long as you won't address the
05:05:08 problem of weather manipulation
05:05:08 which mess with the skies you
05:05:09 are done.
05:05:12 >> you are fake representing a
05:05:15 fake which is sooner or later
05:05:15 it's going to force me to
05:05:19 disobey systematically anything
05:05:20 that the asks you to do
05:05:23 including on the roads you see
05:05:24 oh yeah you can stop.
05:05:27 >> you for you know of course
05:05:31 no absolute incompetence.
05:05:31 Good air sea technology lowers
05:05:34 your intelligence to a level
05:05:35 that you can't get out of the
05:05:35 trap.
05:05:38 >> we said no qr codes, no cell
05:05:38 phones.
05:05:41 It's time bombs.
05:05:42 See, there is an attack coming
05:05:43 up.
05:05:43 I said you have to protect
05:05:46 yourself if you want to be
05:05:49 alive by JULY you don't listen.
05:05:52 Two years ago on the 28th of
05:05:56 FEBRUARY 2023 I said I'm
05:05:56 changing the course of humanity
05:06:00 under the order from the skies
05:06:00 to do it.
05:06:03 >> do you think I was that
05:06:03 sure?
05:06:04 >> do you think you're going to
05:06:07 get away from it?
05:06:07 I just it's an order.
05:06:08 I will do it.
05:06:11 I don't know you wait the more
05:06:11 I get out of control
05:06:14 understanding how to do it
05:06:14 everything is perfectly
05:06:18 orchestrated by this guy's.
05:06:19 >> I guarantee you that that's
05:06:22 what you so last but not least,
05:06:29 what is it next time you tired
05:06:30 me today big time.
05:06:31 But I'm coming back.
05:06:33 Of course.
05:06:34 Thank you for your comments.
05:06:34 Welcome.
05:06:40 next speaker it evening I'm
05:06:41 here concerning my son I am
05:06:45 very disappointed and I know
05:06:45 we're not speaking on it but
05:06:48 I'm hoping that the resolution
05:06:53 that he made going to be
05:06:56 passed and I use the overhead
05:07:00 the resolution that max carter
05:07:03 of wisdom I implement it for
05:07:07 unsolved homicides.
05:07:14 I know matt darcy is going to
05:07:14 help with that.
05:07:14 Right.
05:07:17 Please.
05:07:22 I bring this with me because it
05:07:26 says that former mayor gavin
05:07:29 newsom he said I know who
05:07:30 killed her son.
05:07:33 Did gavin newsom said the D.A.
05:07:36 No, the police know.
05:07:37 If you know all of this, why
05:07:43 isn't our cases solved?
05:07:44 I have nothing against them.
05:07:47 But this was a slap in the face
05:07:51 and I still look at it today I
05:07:55 pray I mean for someone to say
05:07:55 they know I'm not nothing
05:07:58 against him but that's showing
05:07:59 that people know who killed my
05:08:02 son but they say what no
05:08:03 witnesses quote unquote no
05:08:06 witnesses.
05:08:10 I carry my pictures with me
05:08:14 every day for this is what the
05:08:17 perpetrators left me and people
05:08:20 that are helping us are being
05:08:24 taken away from us.
05:08:28 Our children.
05:08:29 >> I have to fight for my child
05:08:30 a child again, it's almost like
05:08:33 killing him again over and over
05:08:36 again I keep having to fight
05:08:40 and I'm asking for you
05:08:44 supervisors to to think about
05:08:44 unsolved homicides.
05:08:48 Thank you, MS..
05:08:48 >> brown.
05:08:52 Please ask thank you.
05:09:02 Next speaker please.
05:09:03 >> my name is marcello fonseca.
05:09:09 i am a career cab driver prop a
05:09:13 of 2007 which gave the mta
05:09:14 plenary power over taxi related
05:09:18 matters were sold to the taxi
05:09:21 industry as a promise of
05:09:21 reform.
05:09:25 >> our mayor back then
05:09:29 mentioned that in his quest to
05:09:30 monetize taxi permits he
05:09:33 mentioned that taxi medallions
05:09:33 had been underutilized and the
05:09:37 taxi industry had
05:09:37 underperformed.
05:11:17 Ironically what we have today
05:11:17 is a crisis.
05:11:18 We have a dysfunctional
05:11:18 medallion sales program.
05:11:18 We have a broken medallion
05:11:18 system.
05:11:18 We have hundreds of medallion
05:11:18 buyers.
05:11:19 The real victims of the failed
05:11:19 medallion sales program
05:11:19 drowning in debt.
05:11:19 They are driving themselves to
05:11:19 their graves with no future
05:11:20 prospects.
05:11:20 We also have the aging
05:11:20 population of medallion holders
05:11:20 who acquired their permits
05:11:20 under prior rules who are being
05:11:20 relentlessly targeted by the
05:11:21 mta just because they can no
05:11:21 longer drive the george
05:11:21 horrible a medallion holder who
05:11:21 drove full time for 43 years
05:11:21 had he went through seven
05:11:22 hearings before the mta was
05:11:22 finally successful in revoking
05:11:22 his medallion after sitting
05:11:22 here for five hours to speak
05:11:22 now I understand that this
05:11:22 medallion crisis is not the
05:11:23 only problem sen francisco is
05:11:23 faced with but it is a san
05:11:23 francisco problem.
05:11:23 I'm here to ask you to remind
05:11:23 you that it requires the
05:11:23 political will of the city of
05:11:24 san francisco to resolve this.
05:11:24 maybe you could form a
05:11:24 committee to address this
05:11:24 matter, work with the mayor's
05:11:24 office and direct the mta to do
05:11:25 a better job.
05:11:25 >> this has been going on for
05:11:25 too long.
05:11:25 >> thank you for your comments
05:11:25 .

05:12:49 lower the price on medallion
05:12:52 from $250,000 to 150 $125,000
05:12:56 because mta sold 200 medallion
05:12:59 with that price ten years ago.
05:13:03 The mta is using the taxi
05:13:03 ticket against us.
05:13:07 >> we never ask about free ramp

05:13:11 taxi medallions.
05:13:14 >> so please concerned our

05:13:22 >> thank you.
05:13:23 >> thank you for your comments.
05:13:29 Next speaker my name is ali.
05:13:32 I'm the same medallion problems
05:13:33 and you guys know all these
05:13:37 things so I want to tell you my
05:13:37 pain.
05:13:40 This pain has been growing day
05:13:41 in and day out for more than a
05:13:44 decade.
05:13:44 Nobody feel that pain because
05:13:47 only the person who go through
05:13:48 that pain who feels that pain
05:13:51 and we've been feeling that
05:13:52 pain for years how many people
05:13:52 assassinated?
05:13:56 How many people have a heart
05:13:56 attack?
05:13:59 How many people have a stroke
05:13:59 and we're still holding on
05:14:03 hoping that hopefully they'll
05:14:03 fix that problem.
05:14:07 But if you feel that pain then
05:14:07 you will fix that.
05:14:10 But every other step can do it.
05:14:11 Why can you not do that?
05:14:14 But I just say I'm not a mean
05:14:14 person.
05:14:18 I'm not a bad person but I will
05:14:19 say my lord as much as pain
05:14:21 we've been getting from the
05:14:22 people who are accountable for
05:14:25 that just not more and not a
05:14:29 lot, not less they should get
05:14:30 the same pain we've been going
05:14:33 through so then they will feel
05:14:34 it and then they'll fix it if
05:14:37 they fix the problem then i
05:14:38 will say GOD relieve the pain
05:14:39 of them because they felt our
05:14:41 pain and fix our problem.
05:14:42 >> thank you.
05:14:43 Thank you for your comments.
05:14:49 Next speaker thank you
05:14:49 supervisors mark gruber with
05:14:52 the san francisco taxi workers
05:14:53 alliance.
05:14:56 I imagine that most people
05:14:57 in this room are appalled at
05:15:00 what's going on in washington
05:15:00 and across the country.
05:15:01 Among other things, the trump
05:15:04 administration has declared war
05:15:05 on some of the most powerless
05:15:08 and vulnerable among us our
05:15:09 immigrant population.
05:15:12 What distinguishes places like
05:15:13 san francisco from the get rid
05:15:15 of the mall crowd is support
05:15:16 for their struggles, respect
05:15:19 for their humanity.
05:15:20 And yet despite all his
05:15:23 professed values, san francisco
05:15:23 has betrayed and abandoned an
05:15:27 immigrant population right here
05:15:27 in its midst.
05:15:30 San francisco taxi drivers it
05:15:31 betrayed them by luring
05:15:32 hundreds of them into
05:15:35 purchasing taxi medallions that
05:15:36 previously were earned through
05:15:39 experience and again by
05:15:39 allowing uber and lyft to
05:15:40 operate illegally and yet again
05:15:43 by failing to fix the broken
05:15:46 system it created not a single
05:15:47 taxi medallion has sold for
05:15:47 nine years.
05:15:51 In the meantime, 40% of these
05:15:51 drivers have lost their
05:15:55 medallions to foreclosure for
05:15:55 the ones that are left the
05:15:56 prisoners in the system the
05:15:59 only way out for them at this
05:16:02 point is default or death.
05:16:03 >> the mta and the san
05:16:04 francisco federal credit union
05:16:06 are supposedly negotiating a
05:16:07 solution to this debacle but
05:16:10 it's been dragging on for years
05:16:11 and the people with the most to
05:16:14 lose the medallion holders have
05:16:17 no seat at the table who will
05:16:18 look out for their interests
05:16:19 while the mta is looking out
05:16:22 for its own.
05:16:22 It's a classic conflict of
05:16:25 interest.
05:16:26 This program has failed long
05:16:26 ago.
05:16:28 The mta has made $63 million on
05:16:33 medallion sales and their
05:16:33 self-interest in any resolution
05:16:37 is self-evident this board
05:16:40 needs to step in.
05:16:41 You have power over the mta's
05:16:44 budget.
05:16:45 You have power if need be to
05:16:48 put this before the voters and
05:16:48 you have the power and in my
05:16:51 view the obligation to right
05:16:52 this wrong.
05:16:52 >> thank you.
05:16:53 Thank you for your comments.
05:16:57 Next speaker.
05:16:58 Yeah hi.
05:17:01 I just saw my colleague speak
05:17:01 about this city.
05:17:02 This is not a city this is not
05:17:05 a liberal city.
05:17:06 It's a cruel and callous city
05:17:10 who preys on its weak and
05:17:11 vulnerable because they cannot
05:17:13 fight back.
05:17:14 >> we have been coming here for
05:17:15 15 years has denied anything
05:17:17 being done.
05:17:18 >> no, because I don't have
05:17:18 lots of money.
05:17:21 I don't have 500 people behind
05:17:21 me.
05:17:24 You only work for somebody who
05:17:28 has a lot of clout among
05:17:28 themselves.
05:17:29 And one thing this gentleman
05:17:32 was set free and not ten times
05:17:33 about lambert street.
05:17:36 Lambert what is happening over
05:17:37 there?
05:17:37 Can you guys say something for
05:17:40 the cab drivers?
05:17:41 Do not fear we are with you but
05:17:44 I know it won't happen.
05:17:45 It will not happen simply
05:17:48 because uber, venmo and others
05:17:51 they are more powerful and they
05:17:52 have much more money to spend.
05:17:56 I am not seeing what you think
05:17:56 I'm saying but I'm just
05:17:57 speaking my mind.
05:18:00 This is what I feel people have
05:18:03 a right but you can't just sit
05:18:03 there.
05:18:04 I know there are a lot of new
05:18:06 supervisors they do not know
05:18:07 what's going on but I want to
05:18:10 tell them have a heart, have
05:18:10 mercy.
05:18:11 You have to sleep just like I
05:18:14 sleep at night.
05:18:15 Do you sleep peacefully?
05:18:18 I want you to sleep peacefully.
05:18:21 >> bring the price down to one
05:18:21 25,000.
05:18:21 Why?
05:18:25 Because most of the drivers the
05:18:25 medallion owners have already
05:18:29 paid that by might amount.
05:18:30 >> take my medallion sell it.
05:18:33 They'll be so many buyers young
05:18:33 kids who want to buy it.
05:18:37 But again will you work on it?
05:18:40 GOD knows only I can pray and
05:18:41 across the providence that some
05:18:44 sense goes into your head that
05:18:45 you think about the vulnerable
05:18:48 and the who cannot fight back.
05:18:52 Some day this will happen.
05:18:53 >> let's see sooner than later.
05:18:53 Thank you.
05:18:55 Thank you so much for your
05:18:55 comments.

05:19:24 together.
05:19:25 >> here we go.
05:19:25 I'm not biased.
05:19:29 I just don't know he she it
05:19:30 wants to defund the police
05:19:33 because they're cleaning the
05:19:33 neighborhood up and protecting
05:19:34 its property.
05:19:37 Todd davis says would you you
05:19:38 would think if you knew you

05:20:37 and deaths you know there are
05:20:38 very involved in policy here as
05:20:40 well.
05:20:41 >> I just want you to recognize
05:20:44 how dangerous this is as a
05:20:45 trans person, a latin next
05:20:47 person in this country even
05:20:48 in san francisco this is called
05:20:49 stochastic terrorism.
05:20:52 >> I keep telling you that you
05:20:53 keep supporting this man and
05:20:55 his psycho bullies who harass
05:20:56 me for wanting to help homeless
05:20:59 people.
05:21:02 >> what the?
05:21:03 >> next speaker, please.
05:21:07 Dangerous man good evening, san
05:21:11 francisco starchild chair of
05:21:12 the libertarian party of san
05:21:15 francisco lp asphaug I just
05:21:15 like to remind folks and this
05:21:18 is maybe more to those watching
05:21:19 on tv or listening or you know
05:21:20 who knows reading this
05:21:23 listening to this in the future
05:21:24 then for the politicians
05:21:26 sitting here because I know
05:21:27 your minds and your careers are
05:21:30 pretty fixed but a lot of
05:21:30 things does can be better
05:21:31 understood if you think of it
05:21:34 as a for profit operation.
05:21:34 I call governments super
05:21:38 corporations.
05:21:39 You know they have all the the
05:21:39 greed, the self-serving, the
05:21:43 institutional dysfunction, the
05:21:43 bureaucracy uncaring of big
05:21:46 corporations.
05:21:47 But on top of that they have
05:21:50 armed gangs of police and
05:21:51 people to enforce their will on
05:21:55 the public non consensually and
05:21:55 all the money that they have
05:21:58 all the money that they get
05:21:59 almost without exception a few
05:22:02 voluntary donations but most of
05:22:03 it is obtained non consensually
05:22:06 basically it's a large criminal
05:22:10 gang and most of what is being
05:22:10 done is also illegal
05:22:14 unconstitutional which is a
05:22:14 fancy word for illegal.
05:22:17 The people carrying it out are
05:22:18 in fact criminals for example
05:22:21 the war on drugs no
05:22:22 constitutional authorization
05:22:24 from 1919 to 1933 this country
05:22:25 had alcohol prohibition that
05:22:27 was voted on in the
05:22:28 constitutional amendment.
05:22:29 There's been no amendment
05:22:32 outlawing marijuana, cocaine,
05:22:35 any other so-called banned drug
05:22:35 .
05:22:36 >> so the people out on the
05:22:39 streets persecuting people for
05:22:40 selling these things and
05:22:40 putting them into their own
05:22:43 bodies arbitrarily consensually
05:22:47 are the criminals the people
05:22:47 criminalizing use of public
05:22:50 space, criminalizing poverty,
05:22:51 trying to sweep people off the
05:22:54 streets who are there because
05:22:55 they don't have housing because
05:22:58 of the policies the has put
05:22:59 in trying to extort money from
05:23:01 people.
05:23:02 It's like they extorted money
05:23:02 for the taxi drivers that we
05:23:05 heard from earlier.
05:23:06 If you have a car you should be
05:23:07 able to drive your car and
05:23:09 charge people for rides without
05:23:10 paying extortion peace.
05:23:13 So the should be able to use
05:23:14 rooms in your house without
05:23:14 paying extortion fees.
05:23:17 >> thank you for your comments
05:23:17 .

05:25:34 How because when we retire we
05:25:38 are allowed our it was going to

05:26:20 for the medallion we were the
05:26:21 only ones who pay for everybody
05:26:24 else and they are all these
05:26:25 companies.
05:26:28 >> they make millions of
05:26:29 dollars and they don't pay
05:26:32 nothing and wake up and they do
05:26:33 and they took our job away.
05:26:36 >> oh now from we were very
05:26:40 busy until now we pay only we
05:26:42 make 1 or 2 trips a billion

05:26:46 We take everything uber takes
05:26:47 everything lifting strawberry
05:26:50 everything and all these cars

05:26:57 leave cars over there and we
05:26:58 get the blame but we are the

05:27:05 don't get nothing we come to
05:27:06 work 16 18 hours a day to make
05:27:09 peanuts or nothing.
05:27:10 >> thank you.
05:27:12 Thank you for your comments.
05:27:23 Next speaker hello.
05:27:23 My name is evelyn ingle with
05:27:24 the san francisco taxi workers
05:27:27 alliance.
05:27:27 I'm here to speak in support of
05:27:30 the taxi medallion holders.
05:27:31 I don't own one but I'm here
05:27:34 for those who paid the 250,000
05:27:35 for their medallion under the
05:27:38 very tragically ill timed
05:27:42 medallion sales program.
05:27:45 250,000 is a lot of money and
05:27:46 historically it made sense the
05:27:49 earning potential of a taxi
05:27:52 medallion was based on a system
05:27:52 established nine decades ago
05:27:53 in cities across the country
05:27:56 taxis were given the exclusive
05:27:57 right to provide on demand
05:28:00 transports ation and
05:28:01 in exchange they were subject
05:28:04 to strict local regulations,
05:28:05 paid fees etc. This is how the
05:28:08 system worked and everyone
05:28:08 understood that even the mta
05:28:11 and that is why they set the
05:28:12 price so high.
05:28:15 So taxi drivers had every
05:28:16 reason to believe that the city
05:28:18 would uphold its end of the
05:28:19 bargain.
05:28:22 But san francisco did not and
05:28:23 the state interfered and they
05:28:26 did not.
05:28:27 And these lightly regulated
05:28:30 uber and lyft flooded the
05:28:31 streets decimating taxi drivers
05:28:35 incomes by mid 2014 taxi trips
05:28:38 had declined by 65% and now
05:28:41 here we are 15 years after this
05:28:47 failed program launched as a
05:28:48 pilot, 40% of medallions had
05:28:51 been foreclosed hundreds of
05:28:51 drivers are still mired
05:28:52 in debt.
05:28:54 They were steered into
05:28:55 predatory balloon loans.
05:28:59 They had to refinance every 3
05:29:02 to 5 years interest payments
05:29:03 were high.
05:29:04 Payments on their principal
05:29:06 were low.
05:29:07 They still owe a lot of money.
05:29:10 We strongly believe that the
05:29:11 city of san francisco must play
05:29:13 a role in resolving this crisis
05:29:14 .
05:29:14 They have an ethical and moral
05:29:18 duty to do so as the helped to
05:29:21 create this crisis we think it
05:29:22 could work along with the
05:29:23 state, the credit union, the
05:29:25 mta to find some resolution.
05:29:29 Aslam never mentioned new city
05:29:31 solved their crisis in 2022.
05:29:32 If new york city can help their
05:29:35 medallion owners, why can't the
05:29:38 city of san francisco.
05:29:38 >> thank you.
05:29:43 thank you for your comments.
05:29:50 If the next speaker.
05:29:50 >> hello, PRESIDENT Gentlemen,
05:29:53 members of the board.
05:29:54 My name is bradley dunn.
05:29:55 I'm the manager of local and
05:29:57 community relations for bart.
05:29:59 I'm here to speak on item
05:30:00 number 27 in support of
05:30:04 regional transportation funding
05:30:05 bart and muni and downtown san
05:30:08 francisco all have a symbiotic
05:30:09 relationship.
05:30:12 We carry about 400,000 people
05:30:16 every month that transfer to
05:30:16 the S.F. Mta and are critical
05:30:20 to the funding and operation of
05:30:20 the S.F. Mta.
05:30:23 We also bring in about 60,000
05:30:27 people on an average weekday to
05:30:28 downtown san francisco and it's
05:30:28 important to recognize that
05:30:31 downtown san francisco recovery
05:30:35 and bart's recovery are linked
05:30:36 together and we appreciate you
05:30:39 bringing forth a resolution
05:30:39 that recognizes that
05:30:40 unfortunately our prior
05:30:44 reliance on, you know, fares as
05:30:47 a means for funding our
05:30:50 operations and work from home
05:30:51 has placed us like many other
05:30:55 transit agencies approaching a
05:30:55 fiscal cliff.
05:30:56 This resolution is important
05:30:59 in recognizing that and that if
05:31:00 we don't find secure stable
05:31:02 funding bart is faced and the
05:31:03 city is faced with terrible
05:31:06 choices like closing service at
05:31:07 9 P.M., cutting lines of
05:31:10 service closing stations that
05:31:11 will all affect our ability to
05:31:11 bring people to downtown san
05:31:14 francisco that is shoppers that
05:31:18 you know shopping in union
05:31:19 square that students that go to
05:31:22 state or city college that san
05:31:23 franciscans in the mission that
05:31:27 go downtown to work this is
05:31:28 essential service and we are
05:31:30 deeply thankful for your
05:31:34 partnership as we work to look
05:31:35 both regionally and at a state
05:31:38 level to solve these crises.
05:31:41 If we don't find those funding
05:31:42 we will see thousands of bay
05:31:45 area residents move towards
05:31:46 vehicles that pour onto san
05:31:49 francisco streets and
05:31:49 jeopardize our climate action
05:31:52 and vision zero goals and we're
05:31:53 looking forward to working with
05:31:53 you to find solutions to these
05:31:55 problems.
05:31:56 >> thank you so much.
05:31:56 Thank you for your comments.
05:31:59 Next speaker I apologize.

05:32:10 and over and for the new mordor
05:32:11 supervisors I welcome you to
05:32:15 our misery.
05:32:16 I only see one of all the new
05:32:18 board of supervisors paid
05:32:19 attention and I want to thank
05:32:20 you for that.
05:32:23 >> the mta took a poll and
05:32:24 asked all the purchasers to
05:32:27 vote to see who to represent.
05:32:29 We have ten representatives.
05:32:30 We're down to like three now I
05:32:33 got the most votes yet when
05:32:33 there was an important meeting
05:32:36 do I get an email advising me
05:32:39 of the meeting and when I
05:32:40 walked into the meeting the
05:32:41 first thing that was said to me
05:32:47 was you were invited here.
05:32:50 We are the most regulated state
05:32:51 in the united states and we
05:32:55 cannot regulate uber and left
05:32:59 isn't there doesn't that just
05:32:59 sound kind of awkward that we
05:33:03 hand that over to the state and
05:33:03 they say, you know what, we're
05:33:06 left their drivers right so
05:33:07 it's not a company?
05:33:09 well, waymo is a fleet.
05:33:10 It's a fleet of cars, guys.
05:33:13 Why are they not mandatory to
05:33:17 own medallions and these are
05:33:24 tech big tech companies.
05:33:29 I just don't understand why no

05:33:44 what's going on with this?

05:33:51 answer questions when when when
05:33:54 when guys when are we get a
05:33:55 hold the city of san francisco
05:33:56 accountable for what you've
05:34:00 done to us you money grab this
05:34:01 for $63 million and we're at
05:34:04 the bare bottom we're done.
05:34:05 Thank you for your call and I
05:34:09 trusted san francisco.
05:34:10 >> I could have done it.
05:34:13 I'm sure I thank you.
05:34:13 Thank you, MR. Sutter.
05:34:16 Next speaker.
05:34:16 Hi.
05:34:20 Good evening, barry toronto
05:34:23 again I want to first say I'm
05:34:24 with essential taxi workers
05:34:24 alliance.
05:34:26 I also drive two different
05:34:27 types of medallions the
05:34:30 purchase of opinion which matt
05:34:31 and his colleagues own which
05:34:34 they're only they're the only
05:34:35 medallions allowed to pick up
05:34:37 from the airport then they're
05:34:38 the k medallions those got
05:34:40 medallions issue before 2010
05:34:41 and they are not allowed to
05:34:44 pick up from the airport at all
05:34:45 unless unless there's a
05:34:48 complete dire need and that
05:34:49 hasn't happened in months.
05:34:52 And when I you know, I've done
05:34:53 both the city is not as busy
05:34:57 and and the airport is not
05:34:57 generating enough trips to
05:35:00 cover not only the loans at the
05:35:01 pay to the credit union but
05:35:04 also to be able to live as
05:35:05 human beings.
05:35:08 It's some days are really good
05:35:11 and some days are so bad so at
05:35:12 the airport and I and if you
05:35:15 saw the letter from the labor
05:35:16 councils I hope you all these
05:35:18 get a resolution to the to
05:35:19 airport commission to require a
05:35:22 hearing and more extensive
05:35:23 transparency on this issue.
05:35:26 The and the other issues you
05:35:30 can do is to is to ask your our
05:35:31 state legislators to for some
05:35:34 more oversight locally of uber
05:35:37 and lyft and and the autonomous
05:35:38 vehicle companies because
05:35:42 waymo's has been a problem for
05:35:42 the other vehicles on the
05:35:45 street with muni with delivery
05:35:46 trucks, with the cabs using
05:35:49 their taxi zones you can find
05:35:50 me when I work at castro market
05:35:53 to walgreens get to take me but
05:35:54 the problem is I can't work all
05:35:57 the time because of of the of
05:36:00 the health issues we created by
05:36:01 by the gnc this morning you had
05:36:04 a discussion and I participated
05:36:05 in public comment regarding how
05:36:08 to how to tax them so you can
05:36:09 also do is maybe pass another
05:36:12 version of measure l and try to
05:36:13 make them more accountable for
05:36:16 their use of the streets and
05:36:17 their interference with
05:36:19 everyday people trying to get
05:36:20 around the streets of san
05:36:20 francisco.
05:36:23 >> thank you for your time.
05:36:26 >> thank you MR. Toronto next
05:36:27 speaker as interesting to hear
05:36:31 about san francisco toyota over

05:36:34 away from home.
05:36:35 Glad to hear that my money is
05:36:37 going to a good cause.
05:36:41 >> there was a really really
05:36:42 low keyed pharmacy on eddy
05:36:45 street that sold just
05:36:46 prescription drugs mostly
05:36:49 almost entirely medi-cal
05:36:52 patients and cvs bought it and
05:36:53 then like six months later they
05:36:54 shut it and they directed
05:36:57 people to their other store
05:36:58 that was like a mile away.
05:37:00 >> and then six months after
05:37:01 that they shut that one down.
